# search-engine-of-emotional-expression

### Motivation

An idea behind this practical assignment is to let student practice material that was learnt during the semester and will enrich the studentsâ€™ IR understanding and even encourage the students to continue to study this area. 

### Task purpose
* Given an emotional lexicon and a few texts you have to:
  1. Tokenize the text while splitting it into sentences.
  2. Remove HTML tags (you may have to).
  3. Perform Stop Words removal (if needed).
  4. Perform Case Folding.
  5. Perform Stemming (if needed).

* Count the appearance of the individual emotional words in the text.
* You should create two data structures to store sentences in relation to documents and store terms in relation to sentences (You may create other data structures per your needs).
* Summarize the words representing one of the six emotions you got (every group will work on one emotion).
* Provide a graphical visualization comparing the emotional distribution of the different texts.
