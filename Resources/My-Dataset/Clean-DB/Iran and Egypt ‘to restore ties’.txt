Iranian Vice President Muhammad Ali Abtahi told Aljazeera on Tuesday that Iran and Egypt had decided to restore full diplomatic relations, though a minister in Cairo struck a more cautious note.
xA0;
x201C;The decision to restore relations has been taken,x201D; Abtahi said. x201C;And in the coming days, insha Allah God willing, we will see the resumption of our relations.x201D; 
xA0;
An Iranian official earlier told Aljazeera correspondent in Tehran both countries would make an official announcement within the next day or two once certain administrative procedures had been finalised.xA0;
xA0;
The move comes after Tehranx2019;s city council passed a resolution, asking for the name of the central Khalid al-Islambuli Avenue to be changed. 
xA0;
Cairo cautious
xA0;
ThexA0;street honouredxA0;the man who shot Sadat dead in 1981. A large mural of al-Islambuli, recognised as a x201C;martyrx201D; for his opposition to the Egypt-Israeli peace deal, looks down from a towering building on the busy street.

But Egypt sounded a contradictory note of caution, sayingxA0;no decision had been taken yet on restoring diplomatic relations with Iran.
xA0;
x201C;Relations between the two countries are on the right track,x201D; said Foreign Minister Ahmid MahirxA0;on Tuesday. The minister said thexA0;change of the street name was x201C;a positive step but it is not only a matter of renaming a streetx201D;. 
Ties between Cairo and Tehran were severed about 25 years ago after Egypt signed a peace deal with Israel and gave asylum to Iranx2019;s deposed shah.xA0;

For Palestine
xA0;
Earlier, an IranianxA0;foreign ministryxA0;official was quoted by AFP as saying the Palestinian national cause was a major factor in the need for Iran and Egypt to cooperate diplomatically.

x201C;Relations with Egypt must now be restored, because this will help the Palestinian people, and this is the wish of all Palestinian groups, notably the jihadi groups,x201D; said spokesman Hamid Riza Asifi.
xA0;
The city council noted a decision had already been taken two years ago to rename the street Intifada Avenue, in honour of the Palestinian uprisings. 
xA0;
However,xA0;some media have reported the name may honour Muhammad al-Dura, the young Palestinian boy who was filmed being shot dead by Israeli occupation troops in GazaxA0;as he and his father sought cover.

xA0;
Policy shift
xA0;
AsifixA0;earlier told the Tehran council of a need for a x201C;positive initiative on the part of the Islamic republicx201D; towards Egypt in light of the x201C;new regional situation, positive signals on the part of the Egyptian leadership and circumstances favourable to the development of bilateral relationsx201D;.
xA0;
x201C;We now consider that the conditions have been metx201D; for restoring full diplomatic relations, Asifi said on Tuesday.
xA0;
Asifi also praised comments by Egyptx2019;s foreign minister in which he said the 1978 Camp David peace deal with Israel was x201C;merely a thing of the pastx201D;.
xA0;
Relations between the two countries were particularly bad when Egypt supported Iraq during its 1980-1988 war against Iran, but trade and other ties have been improving since the 1990s.
