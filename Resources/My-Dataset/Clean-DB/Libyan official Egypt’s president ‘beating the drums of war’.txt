Libyax2019;sxA0;internationally recognised government has denounced Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisix2019;sxA0;threats of military intervention, saying hisxA0;comments were akin to x201C;beating the drums of warx201D;.
El-Sisi on Saturday warned forces loyal to the Government of National Accord GNA based in Tripoli not to cross the current front line between them and forces loyal to renegade commander Khalifa Haftar, whom Cairo backs.
The Egyptian president, who visited an airbase in Matrouh near the Libyan border, alluded to the possibility of sending x201C;external military missions if requiredx201D; adding that x201C;any direct intervention in Libya has already become legitimate internationallyx201D;.
Abdurrahman Shater, a member of the GNA-allied Libyan High Council of State, said his countryx2019;s security and democracy have been in danger since el-Sisi insisted on bringing in military troops that Libyans did not accept.
x201C;Take your hands off us, do not repeat the tragedy in Yemen,x201D; he tweeted.
Shater also said Egypt has intervened in Libyax2019;s internal affairs for four years.

Translation: El-Sisix2019;s speech in front of a crowd of his army near the border is beating the drums of war. Egypt has intervened for four years, which he denied and claimed his concern for Libyax2019;s security.xA0;Libyax2019;s security has been in danger since Egyptx2019;s insistence on undermining democracy and installing a military man whose master we have previously rejected and brought down. Take your hands off us. And do not repeat your tragedy in Yemen.
El-Sisi told his army to x201C;be prepared to carry out any mission here within our borders, or if necessary outside our bordersx201D;.
x201C;Sirte and Jufra are a red line,x201D; he said.
























Conflict in Libya: Another initiative





Forces loyal to the GNA, which is headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, have driven Haftarx2019;s self-styled Libyan National Army LNA from large swaths of territory in the west of the country as well as strategic towns near the capital, Tripoli.
GNA forces have now launched a campaign, moving eastwards, to capture the Mediterranean city of Sirte from forces loyal to Haftar, who was forced to offer a ceasefire after facing a string of defeats in recent weeks.
The ceasefire, backed by Cairo, has been rejected by the GNA and its backer Ankara, which on Saturday demanded that the LNA withdraw from Sirte.
The Egyptian president stressed x201C;any direct interference from Egypt in Libya has now acquired international legitimacy, either with the right to self-defence or at the request of the only legitimate elected authority in Libya, which is the House of Representatives Tobruk.x201D;
Al Jazeerax2019;s Malik Traina, reporting from the Libyan city of Misrata, said el-Sisix2019;s remarks on Saturday were largely ignored by the GNA and its forces.xA0;
x201C;A GNA military commander we spoke to earlier said their forces are adamant and that they will enter Sirte. Itx2019;s important to note that these are forces know the territory well,x201D;xA0;Traina said.xA0;
x201C;In 2011, forces primarily from Misrata were responsible for entering Sirte and killing longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.x201D;
Meanwhile, Egyptx2019;s Foreign MinisterxA0;Sameh Shoukry on Sunday told the Saudi-based Al Arabiya TV his country prioritised a political solution to the conflict, adding that the GNA misinterpreted el-Sisix2019;s comments.xA0;xA0;xA0;
With Turkish support, the GNA has reversed a 14-month assault on the capital by the forces loyal to Haftar, who is backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
xA0;
Both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have expressed their support for the Egyptian presidentx2019;s statements.
x201C;Saudi Arabia stands by and supports Egypt on the right to protect its borders and people,x201D; Saudi Arabia official news agency said in a statement.
Additionally, the UAExA0;foreign ministry said it supports all actions by Egypt to ensure its stability and security.
The LNA still controls eastern and southern Libya, including most of the countryx2019;s oil facilities, and the city of Sirte, at the centre of a recent military escalation.
