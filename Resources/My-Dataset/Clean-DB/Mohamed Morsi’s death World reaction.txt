Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey,xA0;on Monday blamed Egyptx2019;s x201C;tyrantsx201D; for the death of Morsi.
x201C;History will never forget those tyrants who led to his death by putting him in jail and threatening him with execution,x201D; Erdogan, a close ally of Morsi, said in a televised speech in Istanbul.
The Turkish leaderxA0;called the former Egyptian president a x201C;martyr,x201D; Turkey had been among Morsix2019;s biggest supporters.
x201C;May Allah rest our Morsi brother, our martyrx2019;s soul in peace,x201D; said Erdogan, who had forged close ties with the former president.
Thousands in Istanbul joined in prayer on Tuesday for Morsi on Tuesday. The prayer was called by Turkeyx2019;s religious authority Diyanet and took place in the cityx2019;s Fatih mosque.
Erdogan is expected to attend an absentee funeral for Morsi in Istanbul on Tuesday.xA0;
United Nations
United Nations spokesman Stephane DujarricxA0;offered condolences to Morsix2019;s relatives and supporters.
Human Rights Watch
Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Human Rights Watchx2018;s Middle East and North Africa division,xA0;called Morsix2019;s death x201C;terrible but entirely predictablex201D;, given the governmentx2019;s failure to allow him adequate medical care.
x201C;What we have been documenting for the past several years is the fact that he has been in the worst conditions. Every time he appeared before the judge, he requested private medical care and medical treatment,x201D; Whitson told Al Jazeera.
x201C;He was been deprived of adequate food and medicine. The Egyptian government had known very clearly about his declining medical state. He had lost a great deal of weight and had also fainted in court a number of times.
x201C;He was kept in the solitary confinement with no access to television, email or any communication with friends and family,x201D; Whitson said, arguing that there would not be a credible independent investigation on Morsix2019;s death x201C;because their Egyptian government job and role is to absolve themselves of wrongdoing everx201D;.

BREAKING x2013; Egypt news says only democratically elected Pres Morsy has died in prison after stroke. This is terrible but ENTIRELY predictable, given govt failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits. hrw was just finalizing a report on his health.

Mohamed Morsix2019;s son
In a Facebook post, Morsix2019;s son, Ahmed, confirmed the death of his father.
x201C;In front of Allah, my father and we shall unite,x201D; he wrote.
Muslim Brotherhood
Mohammed Sudan, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in London, described Morsix2019;s death as x201C;premeditated murderx201D;, saying that the former president was banned from receiving medicine or visits and there was little information about his health condition.

190617161921218

x201C;He has been placed behind a glass cage during trials. No one can hear him or know what is happening to him. He hasnx2019;t received any visits for months or nearly a year. He complained before that he doesnx2019;t get his medicine. This is premeditated murder. This is slow death.x201D;
The Brotherhoodx2019;s Freedom and Justice political party said in a statement that EgyptianxA0;authorities is responsible forxA0;Morsix2019;s x201C;deliberate slow deathx201D;.
x201C;The Egyptian authorities put him in solitary confinementx2026; they withheld medication and gave him disgusting foodx2026; they did not give him the most basic human rights,x201D; the political party said in a statement published on its website.
The Brotherhood also called for crowds to gather outside Egyptian embassies around the world.
Egyptian politicians close to Morsi
In a joint statement, Amr Darrag, a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a minister of planning and international cooperation under Morsi, and Yehia Hamed, a former Egyptian investment minister under Morsi,xA0;said an international independent investigation into the death of Morsi should be made public.
x201C;The Egyptian regime knew that the continued denial of access to medical treatment would lead to his premature death. To that effect, the death of President Morsi is tantamount to state sponsored murder,x201D; they said in the statement.
x201C;The first democratically elected President has died through a concerted and active campaign by the Egyptian regime. This is a gross violation of international law. It must not be allowed to stand.x201D;
Independent Detention Review Panel
In a statement released after Morsix2019;s death,xA0;Crispin Blunt, chairman of the UKx2019;s Independent Detention Review Panel, said hisxA0;death in custody was representative of Egyptx2019;s inability to treat prisoners in accordance with both Egyptian and international law.
x201C;The Egyptian government has a duty to explain his unfortunate death and there must be proper accountability for his treatment in custody. We found culpability for torture rests not only with direct perpetrators but those who are responsible for or acquiesce in it,x201D; he said in a statement.
x201C;The only step now is a reputable independent international investigation.x201D;
Last year, axA0;reportxA0;by three UK MPs, under the panel, warned that the lack of medical treatment could result in Morsix2019;s x201C;premature deathx201D;.
Amnesty International
Amnesty International urged Egyptian authorities to investigate the death of Morsi.
x201C;We call on Egyptian authorities to conduct an impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances of Mursix2019;s death, including his solitary confinement and isolation from the outside world,x201D; the London-based rights group said in a twitter post.
It also called for an investigation into the medical care Morsi was receiving, and for anyone found responsible for mistreatment to be held accountable.

Egypt must carry out a thorough and impartial investigation into the death of former President Mohamed Morsi who collapsed in a courtroom today. He was held in solitary confinement for six years and was only allowed three family visits during that time. https://t.co/nadwJOIjxO
