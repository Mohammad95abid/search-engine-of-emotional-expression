Inside Story: No mercy for Morsi






He also wanted to meet his defence team to discuss what he said were five incidents in prison that he considered to be life threatening.
Following Morsix2019;s statements, the court ordered that a medical examination be performed on him.
Osama Morsi, the former presidentx2019;s son, implied that his father suspects the food may have been tampered with and that he is x201C;now suffering from a significant shift in treatment in prisonx201D;.
The Cairo Criminal Court on Saturday resumed hearing evidence in the so-called Qatar espionage trial of Morsi, along with 10 others.
The defendants are facing charges of leaking military and state secrets to Doha and x201C;harming the securityx201D; of the country.
Morsi was elected president in June 2012, more than a year after longtime leader Hosni Mubarak was ousted after a popular uprising. The Muslim BrotherhoodxA0;leader was deposed in July 2013 in a military coup, following mass protests against him.
Since then, the Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed and its members have faced a massive crackdown.
Morsi was sentenced to death on charges of murder and attempted murder during a prison break, and the Brotherhood was declared a terrorist group.
He has been appearing in court wearing the red prison uniform reserved for prisoners on death row.
