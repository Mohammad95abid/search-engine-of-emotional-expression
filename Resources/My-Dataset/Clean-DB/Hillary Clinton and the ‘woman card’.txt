x201C;Itx2019;s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, itx2019;s not just strange, itx2019;s unprecedented and deeply troubling.x201D;
These were the words of an angry Hillary Clinton, responding to a letter sent to Congress by the FBI director James Comey regarding newly found emails on a device belonging to a close Clinton aide.
Anger hadnx2019;t been part of Clintonx2019;s carefully constructed 2016 political campaign. Speaking alongside Donald Trump at a charity dinner in New York on October 20 x2013; the last time the two presidential candidates would be seen together before November 8 x2013; Clinton had quipped:xA0;x201C;Donald Trump really is as healthy as a horse. You know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.x201D;
Smiling radiantly, pretty in a Ralph Lauren pink gown no pantsuit!, Clinton had been so comfortable with her audience that she convincingly cracked that joke and quite a few more.xA0;

Itx2019;s never easy being a woman candidate for political office. Throughout a long political career, Clinton was hounded about her looks: her hair, her clothes, her laugh, her smile. Even her ankles came in for criticism.
And she was persistently warned by handlers never to appear aggressive. Or bossy. Or x201C;shrill.x201D;
But the look Clintonx2019;s 2016 presidential campaign had most worried about? x201C;Serious facex201D;.
x201C;No man would ever be at fault for having a serious look on his face,x201D; Elizabeth Kuhnke, author of Body Language for Dummies, explained in a recent Newsweek article. x201C;Resting bitch face doesnx2019;t exist for men simply because itx2019;s a face of authority.x201D; 
Sexism plagues the career of every woman aspirant for office in the US. Yet, when Madeleine Albright, and then Condoleezza Rice, became secretary of state, they consistently scored high marks for popularity.
Clinton followed suit. In polls taken in 2011, she was viewed favorably by 66 percentxA0;of voters x2013; making her more popular than both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

Victims elicit sympathy - the precise quality Clinton is unable to arouse on her own. And victims, when they fight back at their attackers, make us respect and even like them.
 


But a woman appointed to a Cabinet position by a male president x2013; Clinton, Bush, Obama x2013; is quite a different thing than a woman who decides to run for the presidency herself.
Running for president screams not public service but x2026; Ambition.
So what should a self-described x201C;policy wonkx201D; x2013; who happens also to be ambitious, and female x2013; do when running for the presidency? 
A calculated risk
Letx2019;s go back to last April. x201C;Frankly, I think if Hillary Clinton were a man, she wouldnx2019;t get 5 percent of the vote,x201D; Trump told a crowd of supporters. x201C;The only thing shex2019;s got going is the woman card.x201D;
Clinton was quick in her reply: x201C;If fighting for womenx2019;s healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in!x201D;

Trump speaks as Clinton listens during their third and final 2016 presidential campaign debate at on October 19 Reuters

Within hours,xA0;Clintonx2019;s campaign offered x201C;The Official Hillary for America Woman Cardx201D; for sale for $5. Women across the US responded in droves, and within three days Clintonx2019;s campaign raised a record-settingxA0;$2.4m.
Coolly strategic, Clinton took a calculated risk.
Trumpx2019;s misogyny didnx2019;t take long to reveal itself. During a radio interview with Howard Stern, Trump was asked if he would stay with his wife if she were crippled from a car accident. Trump askedxA0;Stern: x201C;How do the breasts look?x201D; x201C;The breasts are OK,x201D; Stern answered. x201C;Sure!x201D; Trump replied, x201C;Because thatx2019;s important.x201D;
One bad comment about women followed another in record speed. Women are x201C;fat pigsx201D;, x201C;dogsx201D;, existing solely to be judged on their grade from men: x201C;9x201D; means youx2019;ve got a babe, x201C;4x201D; a rottweiler.
The other woman running for the presidency, Carly Fiorina, didnx2019;t escape TrumpxB4;s body shaming either. x201C;Look at that face!xA0;Would anyone vote for that?x201D; Trump joked. 
A trust fund baby accustomed to having his way, Trump had never needed to listen. He couldnx2019;t hear the anger building up across the 50 states of the US.
 OPINION: Hillary Clintonx2019;s faux feminism 
But Clinton did. She heard it x2013; and played her hand well. In the first and second debates, instead of calling her opponent Mr Trump, Clinton called him x201C;Donaldx201D;.


Clinton suspected that he would lose his cool. And he did. And when x201C;Donaldx201D; lost his cool, he attacked women x2013; starting with that x201C;nasty womanx201D; across the dais from him. 
Trumpx2019;s x201C;problem with womenx201D; became the focal point of the Clinton campaign.
With each x201C;Donaldx201D;, Clinton goaded her Republican rival into another outrageous blunder, until Trumpx2019;s infamous meltdown during the third debate.
Playing the victim
Women have always known the risk of entering the old boysx2019; club that is American politics x2013; take Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, first woman candidate for vice president, for example.
The morning after her vice-presidential debate with George HW Bush x2013; a debate many commenters said she won x2013; Bush met a group of longshoremen and proclaimed: x201C;We kicked a little ass last night!x201D;
OPINION: US elections x2013; What the polls wonx2019;t tell us
Itx2019;s a long and hallowed American political tradition: a male politician and his supporters sharing a few sexist laughs at a female hopefulx2019;s expense. 
But, as Trump discovered x2013; it stopped working.
Was it that millennial women werenx2019;t swallowing the old gender status quo? While older women x2013; many of whom had fought hard for equal rights in the 1970s and 1980s x2013; finally smelled a chance at grabbing power?
























Hillary Clinton fires back at FBI over email scandal






Trump banked on Clintonx2019;s unlikability to win. Carelessly, he attacked her x2013; and in attacking her, made her a victim.
Victims elicit sympathy x2013; the precise quality Clinton is unable to arouse on her own. And victims, when they fight back at their attackers, make us respect and even like them.
But now Clinton is fighting back against the FBI director x2013; a very different opponent than Trump. And itx2019;s impossible to predict this wild cardx2019;s impact on voting November 8.
A New York Times op-ed from October 15 stated: x201C;For whatever it has done and failed to do, the presidential candidacy of Donald J Trump has revived a national discussion of misogyny.x201D;
But it wasnx2019;txA0;Trump who brought misogyny out from darkness into the light of national debate. The one who did that was Clinton.
With consummate skill, Clinton dug the holes for Trump to fall into. She directed him as to their location. And she made sure that the moments of his falls would be when the largest number of Americans were watching.
Whatever onex2019;s opinion of Clinton x2013; and I, for one, am not a fan x2013; thatx2019;s one masterful performance.
