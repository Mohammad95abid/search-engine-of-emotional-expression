x201C;This man is an opportunity, sir. He is speaking about the timing x2026; they are planning something there in Libya. Yes, he is speaking about a form of secret cooperation x2026; unannounced to anyone x2026; no one will hear or know about it x2026; he will come to you,x201D; said General Abbas Kamel, the chief aide of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in the latest of a series of leaks.
x201C;The manx201D; was Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, Muammar Gaddafix2019;s cousin and chief aide, who was pursued by Libyan authorities after the revolution as well as by InterpolxA0;for alleged crimes against humanity. He was also recently interviewed on a local pro-authorities Egyptian TV channel to publicly declare his support for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL.
The exact date of the leak is unknown. But it was certainly after Sisix2019;s military coupxA0;on July 3, 2013, and before Khalifa Haftarx2019;s first x201C;television coupx201D; on February 14, 2014. The leak revealed no secrets; just further embarrassment. Sisix2019;s military involvement in Libya became common knowledge in official and expert circles around November 2013.
The favour of Egypt
























Will Libya be Egyptx2019;s quagmire?






In August 2014, US officials exposedxA0;secret Egyptian-Emirati air strikes in Tripoli, an unprecedented bombing raid by an Arab Gulf state on an Arab North African capital. More details were exposed recently, and they clearly violated the arms embargo on Libya, and the Security Councilx2019;s 1970 resolution.
x201C;We should not forget the favour of Egypt. Our ammo came from Egypt x2013; 400 containers from there,x201D;xA0;said SaqrxA0;al-Joroushi, the commander of the air forces loyal to Haftar and the Tobruk government, in a YouTube video, while the cheering crowd chanted x201C;Allah akbarx201D;.
In February 2014, Sisix2019;s air force struck again. This time in Derna after a horrific ending of the hostage crisis in Sirte, in which ISIL militants brutally slaughtered 21 Egyptian citizens. After the strike, the regime sought United Nations approval for a military intervention, then for a naval blockade of the Tripoli government, while lifting the embargo on the other side of the civil war. All attempts were diplomatic failures. xA0;
Domestically, the air strikes were popular among regime supporters. But the hysteria promoted by the local media and the Egyptian regimex2019;s hyper-nationalist propaganda diverted the public from asking important questions. For example, having intelligence and security presence in Libya and local allies, what was the regime doing for 50 days since the hostages were kidnapped?
Dismal record
Historically, Egypt has had a dismal record in hostage situations. Unfortunately, the February crisis has been the norm, rather than the exception. Failures in negotiating the safe release of hostages have started from the 1970s, with its bloodiest result in 1985.

The hysteria promoted by the local media and the regimeapos;s hyper-nationalist propaganda diverted the public from asking important questions.
 


Back then, an Egypt airplane was hijacked by Abu Nidalx2019;s organisation and the tragic episode ended in the death of 60 hostages mainly by Egyptian Special Forces, after they stormed the airplane in an attempt to get to the three hijackers. No public revisions were done to the scorched-earth approach; an approach that the institutional culture within the military and security establishments sustain to this day.
x201C;Prestigex201D; of the state and its armed institutions are assigned high value, whereas lower values are assigned to civilian lives within that culture. This is especially the case when the hostages come from impoverished social backgrounds, marginalised regions, and religious minorities.
x201C;Sisi doesnx2019;t have credibility with, and he is in fact an opponent of, the moderate Islamists and they are already looking to use his bombings as a pretence to abandon the talks,x201D; a European diplomat told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. That may be an oversimplification on several levels. Whereas they are part of it, the Tripoli government is not exactly run by x201C;moderate Islamistsx201D; but by a multilayered coalition in which pro-revolution regionalists are a very influential faction. 
The Tobruk government is not exactly x201C;secularx201D; either. It is also composed of a non-homogeneous coalition of military factions, regionalist forces, pro-Gaddafi elements, and pro-revolution ones; with the military faction x2013; led by Haftar x2013; having more clout. The latter believes in the x201C;Sisi modelx201D; of takeover, including using Salafi figures to issue supportive fatwas for repressing rivals.
The western-backed UN strategy has an alternative route x2013; with less bloody prospects and a potentially higher chance of defeating ISIL and like-minded organisations without empowering a ruthless dictator in the process. The immediate objective of the strategy is to build a unity government and Libyax2019;s security and military forces.
Quick response
But the situation in Sirte needs a quick response. Libya Dawn, a military force operating under Libyax2019;s chief of staff loyal to the Tripoli government has deployed the 166thxA0;Battalion around Sirte, in an attempt to take over the city centre, the university, and other areas from ISIL loyalists.
x201C;ISIL forces there are estimated to be somewhere between 100-150 armed vehicles pick-up trucks and four-by-four SUVs,x201D; said Mohammed Abdullah, a General National Congress Tripoli government member and the leader of the National Front Party. The ground troops of Libya Dawn are not enough for a quick, decisive victory though. 
x201C;The force is composed of around 300 armed vehicles,x201D; said Abdullah.
Regardless of how the confrontation between the Tripoli government and ISIL goes, the strategy preferred by the Sisi regime can have disastrous consequences on Libyax2019;s already precarious situation, not to mention the rest of the region. 
The objective of that strategy is not about national reconciliation, social cohesion, democratisation, military and security professionalism, and democratic control of armed actors. It is more about eradication of political rivals, empowering like-minded/loyal military generals, and installing another repressive authoritarian regime on the borders of Egypt, and x2013; where most of the other sides intersect x2013; defeating ISIL. 
But the tactics employed to attain that last objective are more likely to prolong the civil war in Libya and destroy any potential for reconciliation. And with these consequences, a stronger North African version of ISIL is a more likely outcome.
