Abdel Fattah el-Sisi removed any remaining doubt last week when he formally announced his intention to seek a second term inxA0;Egyptx2019;s upcoming presidential elections.
The Egyptian army chief-turned-presidentx2019;s announcement surprised few experts, who say el-Sisi is almost guaranteed to be re-elected after he made it nearly impossible for any real political opponent to challenge his firm grip on power.
x201C;I think the word x2018;electionx2019; is probably too generous,x201D; said Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, about thexA0;votexA0;that isxA0;scheduled to take place in March.
On Tuesday, the army arrested presidential contender Sami Anan, former head of the Egyptian armed forces. Anan was accused of committing violations that x201C;warrant official investigationx201D;, according to the Supreme Committee of the Armed Forces SCAF.
The army said the 69-year-old had not obtained the armyx2019;s approval to run for president and accused him of seeking to divide the armed forces and citizens of Egypt.
Speaking to Al Jazeera before Anan was arrested, Kaldas said the Sisi government has x201C;made it so untenable and so undesirable and so dangerous to runx201D; for president today, that it is x201C;fairly discouraging for anybody who would seriously entertainx201D; the idea.
He also said the Egyptian government appears unconcerned by whether anyone views the election as credible.
x201C;The question is: whatx2019;s worse, a convincing sham, or one thatx2019;s transparently a sham?x201D; Kaldas said.
x2018;A showx2019;
The election is set to take place from March 26-28. Presidential hopefuls have until January 29 to collect enough signatures to officially submit their candidacies.
A runoff vote will be held in April if no candidate receives more than 50 percent support in the first round.
To be eligible to run for president, a candidate must collect 25,000 signatures from constituents across 15 governorates with at least 1,000 signatures from each area, or the signatures of 20 members of parliament, Kaldas explained.xA0;
x201C;The infrastructure for a campaign for anybody is quite limited, and only further undermines how tenable an opposition candidate could be,x201D; he said.
In a televised address announcing his bidxA0;from Cairo on Friday, el-Sisi urged Egyptians to vote in order toxA0;x201C;preserve the democratic experience that began four years agox201D;, referring to the 2014 election, which he won with 97 percent support.xA0;

That election came after el-Sisi led a 2013 military coup that deposed his democratically-electedxA0;predecessor, President Mohamed Morsi, of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood movement.
But in the weeks leading up to the 2018 elections, multiple media reports have suggested that would-be opposition candidates were under pressure to drop out of the race.
x201C;Itx2019;s going to be a show,x201D; said Nezar AlSayyad, an Egyptian historian andxA0;the former head of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of California-Berkeley, about the polls.
AlSayyad told Al Jazeera he expects the Sisi camp to x201C;allow two or three people to runx201D; for president, but it will x201C;absolutely make sure that these people have absolutely no chance of even scoring a few percentage pointsx201D;.
Crackdown on opposition
Last week, Anan announced he would run for president only hours after el-Sisi had confirmed he was seeking re-election.
x201C;I call on civilian and military institutions to maintain neutrality towards everyone who had announced their intention to run and not take unconstitutional sides of a president who will leave his post in a few months,x201D; Anan said.
He also named Hisham Geneina, the former head of Egyptx2019;s anti-corruption watchdog, as part of his election team.
Amr Khalifa, an Egyptian journalist and political analyst, told Al Jazeera that the lead-up to the election has beenxA0;x201C;incredibly well-organised theatrex201D;.
Khalifa said he expected el-Sisito x201C;win the election quite handilyx201D;, not least because of recent events x201C;where he has obliterated those within the inner circles that he views to be problematicx201D; to winning a second term in power.
The political atmosphere in Egypt has left the country without any real opposition, he said.
Egypt has seen an unprecedented crackdown on human rights activists since the 2013 military coup.

Activists have been jailed in large numbers or barred from travelling outside Egypt, while the government also passed legislation to restrict the work of non-governmental organisations.
The NGO law, as it is known, was described by Amnesty International as x201C;a catastrophic blow for human rights groups working in Egyptx201D; that would give x201C;the government extraordinary powers to control NGOs and imposes harsh punishments and fines for any violation of its draconian provisionsx201D;.
The Egyptian government has also blocked access to several websites, including ones belonging to local news outlets and civil society groups.
The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists CPJ, meanwhile, reported that at least 20 journalists were behind bars in Egypt in relation to their work at the end of last year, making it one of the worldx2019;s top three jailers of journalists for 2017.
x201C;How can there be real opposition when there are well over 63,000 political prisoners x2013; that we believe we know of x2013; in Egyptian jails?x201D; Khalifa said.
x201C;Many of these people are part and parcel of the engine of change. When you have agents of change silenced, killed and tortured, how is it that wex2019;re supposed to simply accept a man of the army as being representative of change?x201D;
Khalifa added that Egyptians appear resigned to el-Sisi being re-elected and he expects turnout at the polls to be low. He said many people are asking: x201C;Why should I bother voting, when we already know the results?x201D;
Would-be candidates under pressure
On Wednesday, Amnesty International said Ananx2019;s arrest was x201C;an attack on the rights to public participation and freedom of expressionx201D; in Egypt.
x201C;It appears that Sami Anan has been detained because he was widely considered to be a serious contenderx201D; against Sisi,xA0;saidxA0;Najia Bounaim, Amnestyx2019;s director of North Africa campaigns.
x201C;This is not the first time such a contender has been prevented from running against the incumbent.x201D;
Indeed, a handful of presidential hopefuls have abandoned their campaigns in recent weeks.xA0;
Former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafikx2019;s plan to run was short-lived after he withdrew his potential candidacyxA0;earlier this month. x201C;I saw that I would not be the ideal person to lead the state during the coming period,x201D; Shafik said in a statement posted on Twitter.
One of Shafikx2019;s lawyersxA0;accused the Egyptian government of putting pressure on the 76-year-old by threatening to re-investigate previous corruption allegations against him, the New York Times reported.
Khaled Ali, an opposition leader who ran in the 2012 presidential polls, also announced his intention to run this time around, but he faces a suspended jail term that could hamper his ability to even present his formal candidacy.
The human rights lawyer was sentenced to three months in prison for x201C;offending public decencyx201D; after he allegedly made an obscene gesture during a protest against Egyptx2019;s decision to cede control over two islands to Saudi Arabia.
A hearing in his appeal against that sentence was recently adjourned. x201C;They are fabricating videos against me because I am the lawyer of workers,x201D; Ali told a judge during an appeal hearing on January 4, according to the Egypt Independent newspaper.

x201C;This case was fabricated because I plan running for president,x201D; he said.
In December, Ahmed Konsowa, an Egyptian army colonel, was sentenced to six years in prison after he announced his intention to run for president. Konsowa was charged with x201C;stating political opinions contrary to the requirements of military orderx201D;, his lawyer said.
Another high-profile potential candidate, Mohamed Anwar el-Sadat, the nephew of Egyptx2019;s assassinated former president, Anwar Sadat, also recently cancelled his campaign.
A spokesperson for el-Sadatx2019;s campaign told Reuters that at least three Cairo hotels reportedly refused to rent el-Sadat a space from which to officially launch his candidacy and printers refused to print his campaign manifesto.
x201C;Itx2019;s a systematic campaign to kill off candidates. I call it a political assassination process,x201D; Osama Badie told the news agency.
x2018;Mandate to continuex2019;
Omar Ashour, a professor at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter,xA0;told Al Jazeera he believed the government would allow a candidate to challenge el-Sisi x201C;who is not that threateningx201D;.
x201C;Sami Anan was very threatening. Shafik was very threatening. Even Khaled Ali, despite the lack of military muscle x2026; was a bit threatening,x201D; Ashour said.
x201C;Now wex2019;ll have to wait and see who will come up, probably somebody who does not have that much support on the ground and does not have any support in the military establishment.x201D;
According to AlSayyad, should el-Sisi be re-elected, as most people expect he will be, it will signal a dangerous road ahead for Egypt.
x201C;For many Egyptians who are Sisix2019;s supporters, they are not only going to think the election is legitimate; they are going to think itx2019;s a mandate for him to continue what he is doing,x201D; he said.
