US President Donald Trump laid out a detailed scenario in which he believes he can wrest an election victory from President-elect Joe Biden, declaring x201C;Never bet against me.x201D;
Trump, who has not conceded the race nor has spoken publicly since November 5, described during a Thursday phone call with conservative Washington Examiner columnist Byron York how he sees recounts and litigation changing the outcome in his favour.
x201C;Wex2019;re going to win Wisconsin,x201D; he told York, even though he is behind by just more than 20,000 votes out of nearly 3.3 million cast. It is expected Trump will call for a recount there next week. In 2016, Trump won Wisconsin by 22,478 votes out of almost three million cast and a recount that year affected only 131 votes x2013; in his favour.
x201C;Arizona x2013; itx2019;ll be down to 8,000 votes, and if we can do an audit of the millions of votes, wex2019;ll find 8,000 votes easy. If we can do an audit, wex2019;ll be in good shape there,x201D; Trump continued.















He expressed confidence he will win Georgia after the hand recount of votes that began Friday. x201C;Wex2019;re down to about 10,000, 11,000 votes, and we have hand counting.x201D;
With Michigan and Pennsylvania, x201C;the two big statesx201D;, Trump explained his chances hinge on a series of lawsuits his campaign has filed.

Trump, on losing: apos;Iapos;m a guy who realizes x2014; five days ago, I thought maybe,apos; he said, pausing for just a second. apos;But now I see evidence x2014; and we have hundreds of affidavits.apos; Link: Trump talks post-election fight. https://t.co/9Y6oInJelL

Trump also spoke to pro-Trump journalist Geraldo Rivera, who appears regularly on Fox News, telling Rivera that he is a x201C;x2018;realistx2019; whox2019;ll do the x2018;right thingapos;x201D; but wants to see how the lawsuits and recounts play out.

Just had heartfelt phone call w friend realDonaldTrump who said heapos;s a quot;realistquot; whoapos;ll do thequot;right thingquot; But he wants to see quot;what states do in terms of certifiction etcquot; He sounded committed to fighting for every vote amp; if he loses, talking more about all heapos;s accomplished

He seemed like a heavyweight champion who is behind in points leading into the final round, but determined to fight on, knowing all the refs have scored the fight for the other guy. Still, heapos;s going to answer the final bell, looking for the knockout he knows is a longshot. https://t.co/vPBoL3M1eP

Trump on Friday tweeted more unsubstantiated claims again declaring the election x201C;rigged.x201D; Twitter almost immediately labeled the claims in his tweet x201C;disputedx201D; as it has done with many the presidentx2019;s tweets since Election Day.
x201C;For years the Dems have been preaching how unsafe and rigged our elections have been,x201D; Trump wrote. x201C;Now they are saying what a wonderful job the Trump Administration did in making 2020 the most secure election ever. Actually this is true, except for what the Democrats did. Rigged Election!x201D;

While most Republicans are giving Trump the runway to let his challenges play out, most election law experts and legal observers argue that Trumpx2019;s legal claims are baseless and are destined to fail. And it is not just legal experts who are not giving Trump much of a chance.
The conservative York called it x201C;definitely an optimistic scenario x2013; and one at odds with the current state of the racex201D; and added, x201C;indeed, the picture looks bleak for the presidentx201D;.
Karl Rove, former President George W Bushx2019;s campaign manager during the contested 2000 presidential election that ended up in Bushx2019;s favour, wrote this week in the Wall Street Journal about Trumpx2019;s manoeuvres: x201C;certainly theyx2019;re not enough to change the final outcomex201D;.
x201C;To win, Mr. Trump must prove systemic fraud, with illegal votes in the tens of thousands. There is no evidence of that so far,x201D; Rove argued.
