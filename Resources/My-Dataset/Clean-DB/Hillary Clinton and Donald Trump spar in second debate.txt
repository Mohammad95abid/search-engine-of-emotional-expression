x201C;Trump did what Trump does. He took the questions and turned them into talking points he knows appeal to his supporters,x201D; our correspondent said.
x201C;He knows that if he talks about trade, or ISIL, if he continues to say that Clinton has been a politician for 30 years and achieved noting, he will do well with his support base.
x201C;He was more on message, not as riled and upset as in the first debate. He was really just appealing to his base. But if he is to win this election, he has to broaden his base.x201D;
