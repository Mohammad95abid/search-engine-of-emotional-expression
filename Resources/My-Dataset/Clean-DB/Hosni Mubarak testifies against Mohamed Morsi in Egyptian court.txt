During his testimony against Morsi, Egyptx2019;s first democratically elected president, 90-year-old Mubarak claimed he could not answer most questions, saying he needed permission from the military and current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.xA0;
























Egypt coup: Five years since Sisi took power 3:08





 
Earlier in the month, Mubarak failed to make a court appearance in the case. His lawyer, Farid al-Deeb, had told the Cairo Criminal Court that the former president was a member of the military and that hexA0;had to obtain permission from the military to appear in court.
Since his removal from power in a military coup staged by Sisi, Morsi has been tried in several different cases.
In April 2015, he was sentenced to 20 years on charges of ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in clashes outside the presidential palace in 2012.
In September 2016, Morsi was sentenced to another 25 years in prison on charges of passing intelligence to Qatar. And in December 2017, he was also sentenced to three years on charges of insulting the judiciary.xA0;
After Morsix2019;s 2013 removal, Sisi unleashed a fierce crackdown on his opponents, with tens of thousands jailed with charge and without in conditions condemned by human rights groups.
Amnesty International has described Egyptx2019;s judicial system as x201C;horrendously brokenx201D; and described death sentences handed out to Morsi and other members of the Muslim Brotherhood in previous trials as a x201C;vengeful march to the gallows.x201D;
In axA0;reportxA0;released in March, a panel of British MPs and lawyers said Morsix2019;s conditions of imprisonment had left him facing a x201C;premature deathx201D;.
The panel, which was commissioned by Morsix2019;s family, said the former leader is x201C;receiving inadequate medical care, particularlyxA0;inadequate management of his diabetes, and inadequate management of his liver diseasex201D;.xA0;
x201C;The consequence of this inadequate care is likely to be rapid deterioration of his long-term conditions, which is likely to lead to premature death,x201D; it said.xA0;
