The organisation to which he belonged, the Muslim Brotherhood, has since been outlawed. A government crackdown on the movement, as well as other groups, has resulted in tens of thousands of arrests and mass trials.
Morsi was tried in an Egyptian court on several charges, including one of escaping prison during the 2011 uprising against then-president Hosni Mubarak.
He was also accused of sharing state secrets with foreign powers, including Qatar. His defence argued that he was merely engaging all foreign entities within the limits that any head of state would.
Hundreds of death sentences
Morsi was given several sentences, including life, a 20-year prison term and the death penalty. He appealed against those sentences, but has already had thexA0;20-year term confirmed by an Appellate Court.
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have argued that the trials carried out by the government of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who led the coup against Morsi, have beenxA0;political in nature and violatedxA0;the rights ofxA0;thousands of Egyptians.xA0;
Mass trials have sentenced hundreds of Egyptians to death. Rights groups have also called attention to thexA0;prison abusexA0;in Egyptx2019;s detention system.xA0;
Morsi himself has in the pastxA0;abstained from eating prison food, out of fear for his life.
