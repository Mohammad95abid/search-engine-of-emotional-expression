Egyptx2019;s Sinai Peninsula has long been one of the most under-developed areas of the North African country, despite renewed pledges by successive governments to transform the volatile desert region into a promising tourism and agricultural hub.
The countryx2019;s longest-serving presidents have never been interested in investing resources to develop the area, experts say, including Egyptx2019;s current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

x201C;Every Egyptian regime since declaring the Egyptian republic in 1952 had the ability to transform Sinai into a multibillion-dollar agricultural, mining, industrial, naval and tourist hub,x201D; Sinai researcher and writer Mohannad Sabry told Al Jazeera.
As Egypt approaches its presidential election on Monday, Egyptians are expected to elect Sisi for a second term, but likely not for his renewed pledges on development, nor for his promises to overcome x201C;terrorx201D; attacks in the country.
Dubbed a x201C;shamx201D;, the election is widely expected to see Sisi outwin his only opponent, 66-year-old Moussa Mustafa Moussa, chairman of the liberal El-Ghad Party, and a Sisi loyalist who has previously heavily endorsed the president.
Empty pledges
Following a campaign to silence opposition, Sisi has marketed himself as the only choice for the Egyptian people, including the 1.4 million residents of the Sinai Peninsula who are witnessing his governmentx2019;s x201C;brute forcex201D; strategy to combat armed groups in the region.
Egypt has for years been battling an armed movement in the peninsula, which has gained pace since the military overthrew democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013.
During his 2014 election campaign, Sisi vowed to implement a project that would x201C;fully developx201D; the peninsula within less than two years of his election.
That year, after a deadly suicide bombing that killed 31 soldiers, the general-turned-president declared a state of emergency in the peninsula, describing it as a x201C;nesting ground for terrorism and terroristsx201D;. The declaration brought curfews and highly restricted residentsx2019; freedom of movement.
The failure of his strategies, which have to date claimed the lives of hundreds of Sinai residents and forced many others to flee, poses one of the biggest challenges for Sisix2019;s government.
Sisix2019;s x201C;brute forcex201D; strategy, and his latest military operation, which gave security forces a three-month deadline to restore x201C;security and stabilityx201D; to the peninsula, came after a string of attacks that claimed more than 400 lives in a matter of months.
The death of more 300 people in a bomb and gun attackxA0;on a mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed last year was the largest mass shooting attack the region has seen.

In February 2018, Sisi said the development of the thinly populated region is a matter of x201C;national securityx201D; x2013; a very x201C;catastrophicx201D; view of the region, Sabry noted.
He said that another term would not bring about change, or buy Sisi more time.
x201C;It is not about time but rather strategy, policies and the will to accomplish any reforms or long-term solutions for the regionx2019;s issues,x201D; Sabry said.
x201C;What we are seeing is further deterioration and insistence on flawed policies and total lack of will to apply anything but brute force, creating more damages, and sinking the country into the Sinai dilemma further.x201D;
Last month, Sisix2019;s aides announced that at the end of the governmentx2019;s military operation x201C;Sinai will be transformed to a new Sinaix201D;.
x2018;Security-first approachx2019;
Despite these efforts, analysts Al Jazeera spoke to say people have yet to see a concrete proposal for the areax2019;s development.
According to them, the governmentx2019;s outlook on Sinai will not improve its security or economic standing anytime in the near future.
Issandr El Amrani, head of the North Africa section at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera it is the governmentx2019;s sequential outlook that has prevented it from developing the area.
x201C;It is a security-first approach that postpones the economic development side of things x2013; wrongly so since in the meantime Sinaix2019;s civilian population has paid a heavy cost,x201D; he explained.
x201C;For them, development and economic growth come after the ISIS problem is resolved, and that is taking much longer than they anticipated,x201D; Amrani added, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL, also known as ISIS.

Previous attacks in Sinai have mostly targeted security forces and members of Egyptx2019;s Coptic Christian minority, but mosques in North Sinaix2019;s Sheikh Zuweid town have also been attacked.
The constant violence on the peninsula has led to the displacement of 30,000 families, who have fled the towns of Rafah, Sheikh Zuweid and El Arish over the past two years.
While tourists from around the world travel to enjoy the southern part of the peninsulax2019;s Red Sea coasts and resorts, its northern province, by contrast, is underdeveloped and lacking in basic infrastructure.
Swaying the tribes
Pledges to create 1,500 jobs by establishing x201C;agricultural, industrial and urban communitiesx201D; in Sinai have been perceived by some as a bid by the government to sway Sinaix2019;s mostly tribal residents in joiningxA0;the fight against armed groups.
Sisi has repeatedly called on Sinaix2019;s 11 main tribes to x201C;cooperatex201D; with the countryx2019;s armed forces deployed in the region. Though some responded to the call, experts say these x201C;regime loyalistsx201D; are often x201C;rewarded directlyx201D;.xA0;
Sabry, who has spent years researching the peninsula and its people, said the tribes did not agree to anything.
x201C;They havenx2019;t been allowed to join the effort against ISIS,x201D; he said of the bulk of the tribes.
When asked whether Sisix2019;s pledges acted as a x201C;rewardx201D; for those who wanted to help fight the uprising, regional expert Robert Springborg said the government would likely seek x201C;partnersx201D; in its development projects with those who have sided with it.
x201C;The lack of development is due to the governmentx2019;s interest in facilitating the takeover of touristic lands by those connected to it, rather than in broader development,x201D; Sprinborg, Middle East scholar and a non-resident fellow at the Italian Institute of International Affairs, explained.
The military campaign in Sinai may have marked a new phase of the statex2019;s relationship with Sinai and its people, but it marks x201C;another lowx201D;, Sabry noted.
In the past, leaders of the country have failed to extend services to the peninsula x2013; especially its northern half x2013; rendering it the poorest, least-developed area.
But the question to consider at this time, Sprinborg says, is, x201C;what will the government do if in fact, violence resumes in northern Sinai or elsewhere in Egypt after the end of Operation Sinai 2018?x201D;
