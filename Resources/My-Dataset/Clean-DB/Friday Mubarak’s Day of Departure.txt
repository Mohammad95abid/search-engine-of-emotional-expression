Since January 25, the Egyptian popular protest movement has continued to grow. With violent clashes in Cairox2019;s Tahrir Square threatening to embroil thousands more from the pro- and anti-government camps, the world awaits one manx2019;s decision.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak spoke to his countrymen on February 1, just hours afterxA0;a x201C;million-man marchx201D;, and swore that he would not abdicate his throne, as the Tunisian president had done just weeks before.
While Mubarak did promise that he would not run in the elections to be held later in 2011, most protesters were not satisfied that the 30-year president had met their simple demand x2013; that he resign.
The new vice-president, Omar Suleiman, said on Thursday that the government is willing to hold talks with the Muslim Brotherhood. Yet Suleiman warned that continued calls for Mubarakx2019;s immediate departure would cause chaos in Egypt.
Anti-regime groups are calling for Friday to be Mubarakx2019;s x201C;day of departurex201D; and speculation abounds that new protests could rival last Fridayx2019;s, which erupted soon after midday prayers.
