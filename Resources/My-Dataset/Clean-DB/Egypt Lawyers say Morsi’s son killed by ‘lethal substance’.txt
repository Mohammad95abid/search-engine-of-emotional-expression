Lawyers for the family of Egyptx2019;s ex-president Mohamed MorsixA0;said they obtained information showing his youngest son was killed by x201C;a lethal substancex201D; and not a heart attack as authorities earlier claimed.
Abdullah Morsi, 25, died a year ago on September 4 in a hospital in Giza, southwest of the Egyptian capital Cairo.
A government report at the time said Abdullah was driving his car when he had sudden spasms, and he was immediately taken to a hospital, but doctors were unable to revive him.
Several local news sites reported the death saying there was no criminal suspicion, while noting Morsix2019;s son had suffered several previous health scares, and that he was saddened by his fatherx2019;s recent death.
Mohamed Morsi, Egyptx2019;s first democratically elected president,xA0;died on June 17, 2019, after years in prison while awaiting trial on charges that he and legal observers said were politically motivated.
He was deposed in a 2013 military coup carried out by current President Abdel Fattah el-SisixA0;following a year in power.

Morsix2019;s legal team at Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers announced on Sunday they obtained information that Abduallh had in fact been killed.
x201C;Information now disclosed appears to confirm that Abdullah was transported in his car a distance of more than 20km 12 miles to a hospital after he took his last breath, as a result of having been injected with a lethal substance x2013; and he was not transferred to nearby hospitals, intentionally, until after he had died,x201D; axA0;statementxA0;by the London-based law firmxA0;said.
x201C;It is quite clear that certain elements of the state were aware of this fact that is only now coming to light.x201D;

Toby Cadman, who heads thexA0;Guernica 37 legal team, told the Middle East Eye the circumstances surrounding the death were x201C;mysteriousx201D; and Abdullah hadxA0;lived in fear for his life after publicly accusing some government officials of killing his father.
Over Twitter,xA0;AbdullahxA0;named several individuals x2013; including current Interior Minister Mahmoud Tawfiq and Mohamed Shereen Fahmy, the judge who oversaw the Morsix2019;s trial x2013; as x201C;accomplicesx201D; in the x201C;assassination of the martyr, President Morsix201D;.
Morsix2019;s legal team said the Egyptian Public Prosecution later charged a 36-year-old woman named Randa Ali Shaker Ali Asran with premeditated murder over Abdullah Morsix2019;s death.
The lawyers said Asran has not faced a transparent investigation.xA0;
Cadmanx2019;s legal team concluded Abdullah did not die of a heart attack, but was killed outside his home on September 4, 2019.xA0;
The lawyers accused x201C;certain elements of the statex201D; of being aware of the fact that AbdullahxA0;had been killed, and called for an independent investigation into the alleged murder.
