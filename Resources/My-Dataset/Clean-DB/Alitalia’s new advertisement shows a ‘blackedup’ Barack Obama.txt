Milan, Italy x2013; An Italian airline was accused of racism after a non-black actor portraying former US President Barack Obama was heavily made up to appear as a black person.
Alitalia announced a non-stop flight from Rome to Washington, DC, last May.
The company this week created a series of marketing videos for social media to highlight the route. Each one features four actors playing four United States presidents: Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Donald Trump and Barack Obama.
The advertising campaign, using the hashtag WhereIsWashington, was not creating any major response until it was Obamax2019;s turn to find the flight to Washington. In the video, an actor was covered in heavy black-and-brown makeup to appear African American. His nose was enlarged and his mouth and lips were changed to resemble a black man.
Later the airline companyxA0;apologised for x201C;the offense caused by the promotional videox201D;.
x201C;Alitalia deeply apologises for the offense caused by the promotional video on our new Washington route. It has since been removed from all of our social media channels,x201D; it said in an email statement.
x201C;For our Company, respect for everyone is mandatory, it was never our intention to hurt anyone and we will learn from what has happened.x201D;xA0;

Called out forxA0;blackface, Alitalia initially dismissed the issue on Facebook. x201C;You are exaggerating,x201D; was the reply to an Italian user who suggested the offensiveness of the commercial.
Leonardo De Franceschi, a media and cinema researcher at the University of Rome, confronted the company on Facebook over the marketing campaign that he called x201C;racistx201D;.
Alitalia responded by saying, x201C;The actor we cast is not Caucasian, we used the makeup to change his facial features, not his skin colour.x201D;
However, the actor is not black and his skin tone appears darker after the application of foundation.xA0;
De Franceschi said the incident reflected the downplaying of racist practices in Italy.
x201C;Videos x2013; as the one produced by Alitalia x2013; represent a common standpoint in Italian advertising and the mainstream TV industry,x201D; he told Al Jazeera.
x201C;I think of popular cinepanettoni Italian comedy movies and of more recent films x2026; They reproduce stereotypes and practices x2013; as blackface x2013; that in other countries, United States and United Kingdom, for instance, wouldnx2019;t be tolerated.x201D;
De Franceschi said the practice should not be tolerated in Italian society.
x201C;Films like Bamboozled by Spike Lee remind us that the blackface issue isnx2019;t in the past,x201D; he said. x201C;Sometimes in Italy, people wear blackface in anti-racist and inclusive displays, but that doesnx2019;t make it any less humiliating for people of African heritage.x201D;
x2018;Problem with ignorancex2019;
The use of blackface on the Italian actor of Tunisian decent to play Obama outraged many in Italy, especially Afro-Italians.
The African American writer Louis Pisano also criticised the Italian airline on Instagram for the ad.
x201C;I found this Alitalia video to be offensive because it is an instance of blackface and a mockery of President Obama,x201D; he said. x201C;This type of humour x2013; which positions us as the punchline to a joke x2013; is damaging to the strides black people are making to combat racism.x201D;

Pisano said in the modern era with social media and its global reach x201C;this mindset only sets a country back in terms of intellectual advancement.x201D;
x201C;I think that Italy has a huge problem with ignorance that perpetuates the cycle of racism and racist attitudes x2026; There is almost an unwillingness to educate themselves on historically racist practices that happened both here and abroad.x201D; xA0;
Pisano said what makes the video even more offensive is that it comes from a company as influential as Alitalia is in Italy. x201C;It becomes ingrained in the masses that this behaviour is acceptable,x201D; he said.
