GeorgexA0;Bush contemplated ordering a US military strike against a suspected Syrian nuclear facility at Israelx2019;s request in 2007, the former US president has reminisced in his memor to be published soon.
Israel eventually destroyed the facility, which Syria denied was for developing a nuclear weapons.
In his memoir, x201C;Decision Pointsx201D;, to hit bookstores on Tuesday, BushxA0;says that he received an intelligence report about a x201C;suspicious, well-hidden facility in the eastern desert of Syriax201D; that looked similar to a nuclear facility at Yongbyon, North Korea.
Shortly afterward, he spoke by phone with Ehud Olmert, then the Israeli prime minister.
x201C;George, Ix2019;m asking you to bomb the compound,x201D; Olmert told Bush, according to the book, a copy of which was obtained by the Reuters news agency.
Bush said he discussed options with his national security team. A bombing mission was considered x201C;but bombing a sovereign country with no warning or announced justification would create severe blowback,x201D; he writes.
A covert raid was discussed, but it was considered too risky to slip a team in and out of Syria undetected.
Bush received an intelligence assessment from then-CIA Director Mike Hayden, who reported that analysts had high confidence the plant housed a nuclear reactor but low confidence of a Syrian nuclear weapons programme.
Bush said he told Olmert, x201C;I cannot justify an attack on a sovereign nation unless my intelligence agencies stand up and say itx2019;s a weapons programme.x201D;
Faulty intelligence
Bush had ordered the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 based on intelligence that said Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were never found.
Olmert was disappointed by Bushx2019;s decision to recommend a strategy of using diplomacy backed up by the threat of force to deal with Syria over the facility.
x201C;Your strategy is very disturbing to me,x201D; Olmert told Bush, according to the book.
Bush denies charges that arose at the time that he had given a x201C;green lightx201D; for Israel to attack the installation.
x201C;Prime Minister Olmert hadnx2019;t asked for a green light and I hadnx2019;t given one. He had done what he believed was necessary to protect Israel,x201D; Bush says in the book.
In Jerusalem, Olmertx2019;s office declined comment on the disclosures in the Bush memoir.
Israel hasxA0;never formally confirmed carrying out the sortie or targeting a nuclear facility.
The Olmert government was pursuing indirect peace talks with Syria at the time.
But Olmert, who resigned in a corruption scandal in 2008, has recently lifted the veil, speaking of a x201C;daring operationx201D; that he ordered despite opposition.
Bush writes that Olmertx2019;s x201C;execution of the strikex201D; against the Syrian compound made up for the confidence he had lost in the Israelis during their 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, which Bush feels had a mixed outcome.
Lebanonx2019;s young democracy emerged from the conflict stronger for having endured the test, Bush says, but x201C;the result for Israel was mixed.x201D;
x201C;Its military campaign weakened Hezbollah and helped secure its border. At the same time, the Israelisx2019; shaky military performance cost them international credibility,x201D; Bush says.
