Former President Barack Obama says he is x201C;troubledx201D; by Republicans x201C;going alongx201D; with President Donald Trumpx2019;s unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and argues it is x201C;delegitimisingx201D; democracy.
x201C;They appear to be motivated, in part, because the president doesnx2019;t like to lose and never admits loss,x201D; the former president told CBS Newsx2019;s 60 Minutes in an interview to air on Sunday night.
x201C;Ix2019;m more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humouring him in this fashion,x201D; Obama continued. x201C;It is one more step in delegitimising not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And thatx2019;s a dangerous path.x201D;

Barack Obama tells Scott Pelley Republicans who x201C;go along withx201D; the Presidentx2019;s claims of election fraud put democracy on x201C;a dangerous path.x201D;

Since Joe Biden was declared president-elect on Saturday, Trump has yet to concede, as is tradition. His campaign has also filed numerous lawsuits challenging votes and the administration of the election in several key states while also backing recounts in states such as Georgia and Wisconsin.















While some Republicans have congratulated Biden and are recognising him as the next president, many have held off and instead are either outright supporting Trumpx2019;s election challenges or urging patience as the process plays out.
Obama spoke to CBS to promote his new memoir, A Promised Land, which will be released on Tuesday.
In the book, the former president talks about why he thinks his presidency x2013; and his race x2013; were the foundation for Trumpx2019;s own election in 2016.
x201C;It was as if my very presence in the White House had triggered a deep-seated panic, a sense that the natural order had been disrupted,x201D; Obama writes, according to excerpts of the book obtained by CNN.
x201C;Which is exactly what Donald Trump understood when he started peddling assertions that I had not been born in the United States and was thus an illegitimate president. For millions of Americans spooked by a Black man in the White House, he promised an elixir for their racial anxiety.x201D;
