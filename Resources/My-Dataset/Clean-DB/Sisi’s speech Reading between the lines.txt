Egyptian Field Marshall Abdel Fattah el-Sisi recently committed to doing exactly what he promised his June 30 collaborators he would not do x2013; run for the presidency.
Sisix2019;s speech served as another ominous reminder that Egypt is not headed towards anything resembling a democratic state. He made no reference to gross human rights violations, the fact that Egyptx2019;s media is mostly propagandist and one-sided, or the fact that criticism of his person is essentially off limits in Egyptx2019;s current public sphere. All that is making a serious debate on political issues and a real competition for president impossible. Significantly, would-be candidates for president have already said they will not run, citing unfair political conditions. 
Sisi also did not emphasise national reconciliation or political inclusion. Importantly, Egyptx2019;s current x201C;roadmapx201D; excludes the Muslim Brotherhood, the group that dominated Egyptian elections for the two years immediately following the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak. 
 
























Egypt presidential poll set for late May




Sisix2019;s discussion of x201C;the nationx201D; and x201C;the will of the peoplex201D; x2013; apparent references to his supporters and those who backed the events of June 30 and July 3 x2013; was consistent with post-July 3 Egyptian political and media rhetoric. This seems to suggest that Egyptians who supported the July 3 military intervention that ended Mohamed Morsix2019;s presidency are patriotic citizens, while those who opposed it are not. 
In an apparent nod to inclusiveness, Sisi did say that non-criminals would be welcomed as partners x201C;to no limitx201D;, but this statement would seem to exclude the Brotherhood, who have been labelled terrorists and blamed for a host of crimes. 
Sisi also made it clear that his aim in running for president is to x201C;servex201D; Egyptians in typical military fashion, with his speech exhibiting significant strongman characteristics. For instance, in the speech, he highlighted his military uniform and history, said he would serve Egypt as x201C;a soldierx201D;, suggested that Egyptx2019;s key battle is against x201C;terroristsx2026; who are working for the destruction of our livesx201D;, and lamented that both the x201C;prestige of the statex201D; and the x201C;state apparatusx201D; had been severely damaged in the aftermath of the January 2011 uprising. He strongly suggested that his presidency would be able to address these problems. 
Although he claimed he desired a x201C;democraticx201D; and x201C;modernx201D; state, and said he would respect the outcome of any election, he offered no assurances, and, more importantly, chose to ignore obvious and important prerequisites to a democratic turn. Any chance at democracy in the short term would require, at a bare minimum, the release of the 16,000 political prisoners currently held in Egyptian jails and police stations,xA0;independent investigations into mass killings, and allowing all of Egyptx2019;s political entities to participate equally in political life.
Given the degree to which Sisix2019;s post-July 3 government is implicated in crimes, such measures remain highly unlikely. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that his speech did not broach these issues or offer any indication of a serious democratic transition.xA0;
