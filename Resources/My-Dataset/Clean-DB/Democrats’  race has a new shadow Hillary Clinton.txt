Some Democrats are putting up caution signs for Hillary Clinton as she wades back into presidential politics by casting 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard as a x201C;Russian assetx201D;, mocking President Donald Trumpx2018;s dealings with a foreign leader and drawing counterattacks from both.
Bernie Sanders, who lost the 2016 nomination to Clinton and is running again in 2020, took to Twitter with implicit criticisms of his erstwhile rival.
x201C;People can disagree on issues,x201D; Sanders wrote on Monday, x201C;but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.x201D;
Larry Cohen, one of Sandersx2019; top supporters, was more conciliatory but warned in an interview that Clinton could harm the eventual 2020 nominee by weighing in against specific candidates, even a long-shot such as Gabbard.
The former first lady, US senator, and secretary of state has x201C;put a lifetime into the Democratic Party. She deserves to be heardx201D;, said Cohen, a prominent member of the Democratic National Committee who also chairs Our Revolution, the spinoff of Sandersx2019; last presidential campaign.
But x201C;in this senior leader role she hasx201D;, Cohen said, x201C;itx2019;s her job to embrace the range of politics within the party and not polarise within itx201D;.
Her scuffle with Gabbard and other recent headlines she has driven demonstrate the 71-year-old remains a political lightning rod, just as she has been through much of the last three decades.
The dynamics raise questions about how Clinton and her party can best leverage her strengths and navigate her weaknesses through next November.
x2018;In her own categoryx2019;
For her part, aides say Clinton is not attempting any calculated play.
x201C;The short of it is that shex2019;s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,x201D; said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. x201C;Itx2019;s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but itx2019;s as simple as that. Shex2019;s out there telling the truth.x201D;
Yet the results can frustrate those trying to win the office that Clinton twice lost, a reality presidential hopeful Cory Booker observed with a carefully calibrated critique while he campaigned on Monday in New Hampshire.
x201C;We need to focus on winning this election x2026; talking about the urgencies that we have before us and not indulging in what I think is, for me, not a relevant story,x201D; Booker said, targeting the news media more than Clinton or Gabbard.
There is no settled playbook for former nominees x2013; or former presidents x2013; in party politics.
Sitting senators such as Democrat John Kerry and Republican John McCain returned quietly to Capitol Hill.
Democrat Al Gore became a leading advocate for climate action. McCainx2019;s running mate, Sarah Palin, has made perhaps the biggest recent splash as a conservative media sensation who helped stoke a base that ultimately embraced Trump.
But Clinton x201C;is in her own categoryx201D;, said Karen Finney, a top aide on her 2016 campaign.
The first woman to win a major party presidential nomination x2013; and the national popular vote leader with almost three million more votes than Trump x2013; Clinton remains a popular figure in her party, even after enduring criticism for losing key Midwestern states to Trump.
For Republicans, she is an evergreen foil, used currently in the Mississippi governorx2019;s race, where Democratic nominee Jim Hood, a longtime attorney general, is being attacked for acknowledging he voted for her over Trump.
Clinton vs Gabbard
Finney said the 2016 circumstances, a continued focus on Russian interference and the ongoing House impeachment inquiry against Trump all added to the intensity of feelings for Democrats and Republicans alike: x201C;That gives her a unique voice and perspective.x201D;
The latest fracas started last week when Clinton suggested on a podcast that Russians are x201C;grooming Gabbard to be the third-party candidatex201D;.
Clinton produced no evidence that Moscow is directly backing Gabbard, but Russian state-owned media and a number of alt-right websites have promoted the congresswomanx2019;s Democratic campaign, and the Russian embassy defended her on Twitter.
A military veteran, Gabbard has carved an unusual political profile with criticism of long-held US foreign policy and defence of Trump.
Gabbard retorted by calling Clinton x201C;the queen of warmongers x2026; and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so longx201D;.
Trump piled on as well. x201C;Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent,x201D; Trump complained at the White House on Monday. x201C;These people are sick. Therex2019;s something wrong with them.x201D;

Separately, Clinton needled Trump in recent days by tweeting a parody letter in the voice of President John F Kennedy to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the Cold Warx2019;s Cuban Missile Crisis.
The document, originally from comedian Jimmy Kimmelx2019;s late-night show, played off Trumpx2019;s recent letter warning the Turkish president that history would judge him x201C;forever as the devilx201D; if he did not x201C;work out a good deal!x201D; over Kurdish lands in northern Syria.
And amid all that, the State Department released its final report into Clintonx2019;s use of a private email server as secretary of state, an issue Trump seized upon in 2016 to paint Clinton as corrupt.
Illustrating the perpetual Clinton dichotomy, most mainstream media and Democratic partisans emphasised the reportx2019;s core finding that there was x201C;no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information,x201D; while conservative media and Republicans played up the determination that 38 current and former State Department officials violated protocol on handling sensitive information.
Cohen, the Sanders backer, said none of that meant Clinton was not in prime position to help Democrats in 2020. And Booker, even as he lamented the Gabbard kerfuffle, called Clinton an x201C;extraordinary statesperson in our partyx201D;.
Clinton has headlined at least two DNC fundraisers this cycle and more are expected. Merrill said she talks regularly to several Democratic presidential candidates. And Finney predicts Clinton x201C;will be out on the trail in 2020,x201D; if not for the nominee, then for x201C;any of the record number of women who will be runningx201D; for other offices.
And while Republicans, including Trump, continue aiming at a long-favoured target, not everyone in the GOP thinks it will work as well as it has in the past.
x201C;All the things that she warned us about in 2016 have come true,x201D; said GOP strategist Rick Tyler. x201C;So she has the gravitas to weigh in. x2026; Shex2019;s now a net positive for Democrats, not a negative.x201D;
