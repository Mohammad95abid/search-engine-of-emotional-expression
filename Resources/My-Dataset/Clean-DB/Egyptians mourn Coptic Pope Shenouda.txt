Egyptx2019;s Christians are mourning the Coptic Pope Shenouda III, the leader of the Middle Eastx2019;s largest Christian minority, whoxA0;has died at the age of 88.
Within an hour of Saturdayx2019;sxA0;announcement of his death, traffic was jammed for kilometres leading to St Markx2019;s Cathedral in Cairo, where the spiritual leader was based.
Tens of thousands of Christians packed into the cathedral, chanting:xA0;x201C;We love you, Father,x201D; in memory of the pontiff who had led their community since 1971.
Shenouda died in his residence at the cathedral, and the state news agency MENA said he had been battling liver and lung problems for several years. Health issues forced him to cancel his weekly sermon on Wednesday.
x201C;He died from complications in health and from old age,x201D; his political adviser Hany Aziz said.
Condolences poured in from Egyptx2019;s Muslim leaders and from politicians.
x201C;Egypt has lost one of its rare men at a sensitive moment when it most needs the wisest of its wise x2013; their expertise and their purity of minds,x201D; said Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayib, grand imam of Egyptx2019;s highest Islamic authority, al-Azhar.
Shenoudax2019;s successor will play a central role in forging the churchx2019;s position in the country after the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak last year. Islamist parties have since emerged as a dominant political force in parliamentary elections.
Sectarian violence
Shenouda led the Coptic Orthodox Church through 40 years of quiet expansion, including a strong growth in North America.
Most of the churchx2019;s more than 10 million members are in Egypt, where Copts are believed to make up around 10 per cent of the population.

x2013;xA0;Pope Shenouda




For Egyptx2019;s Christians,xA0;Shenouda was a charismatic leader, known for his sense of humour x2013; his smiling portrait was hung in many Coptic homes and shops. But inxA0;recent years, somexA0;criticised himxA0;for not speaking out on Coptic rights, particularly as sectarian violence seemed to increase.
The later part of his papacy was marked by co-operation with Mubarak and, after the revolt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. When sectarian clashes began to erupt after Mubarakx2019;s removal, including church burnings throughout the country,xA0;Shenouda praised the military leadership for helping to rebuild.
But in October, when soldiers brutally dispersed a Coptic protest outside state media headquarters, leaving at least 26 people dead, Shenouda declared that those killed were martyrs and blamed the military for the violence.
x201C;These martyrs are our beloved children and their blood does not come cheap,x201D; he said.
x201C;I, along with all the bishops, priests and monks, will pray for them. And we know that God will forgive their sins.x201D;
Exile and return
Shenouda worked as a journalist before spending years as a monk and being elected pope.
In the 1980s, hexA0;spent more than three years in exile in a desert monastery after former President Anwar Sadat stripped him of his powers by decree.
At the time, Shenouda had been pressing for more rights for the Coptic community and trying to preserve his congregation from escalating attacks by Muslim extremists.
Mubarak cancelledxA0;Sadatx2019;s decree in 1985, and Shenouda returned to lead Christmas Mass before a crowd of thousands in St Markx2019;s Cathedral.
