Egyptx2019;s parliament speaker agreed to strip Talaat Sadatx2019;s parliamentary immunity after a request from military prosecutors earlier this month following his remarks about Sadatx2019;s assassination.
Sadat has said his comments were not intended to insult the military establishment, and later published newspaper advertisements professing respect for the army.
