It only took him seven years. But maybe it was worth the wait.xA0;
On Wednesday afternoon, the president of the United States mounted a podium inside a Maryland mosque to give a much-trailed speech challenging the rising tide of anti-Muslim bigotry in his country. Although, as the author and lawyer Qasim Rashid joked on Twitter, x201C;I heard POTUS wants to make his landmark address at a mosque a truly authentic American Muslim experience, so hex2019;s arriving an hour late.x201D;
Born to a Muslim father from Kenya, raised from the age of six to 10 by a Muslim stepfather in Indonesia, Barack Hussein Obama has been dogged by crazy, conspiratorial claims that he is a x201C;secret Muslimx201D; ever since he first declared his candidacy for president.























US President Barack Obama visits Baltimore mosque





Banal Islamophobia
A recent poll found that 29 percent of Americans and 43 percent of Republicans still believe Obama is a Muslim and, as Salon noted:xA0;x201C;The number of Republicans who think Obama is a Muslim has actually increased since 2010.x201D; For the record, the president is a Christian who had both of his daughters baptised.
It cannot be stated often enough that the astonishing prejudice, not to mention sheer ignorance, displayed by Republican voters in states such as Iowa x2013; where only 49 percent of them believe Islam should be legal x2013; is the product of a well-funded and coordinated campaign to demonise Islam and Muslims in the US.
This has ranged from nonsensical protests against x201C;creeping shariax201D; to a manufactured controversy over the so-called x201C;Ground Zerox201D; mosque; from claims that Hillary Clintonx2019;s chief aide is part of a Muslim Brotherhood plot to infiltrate the US government, to smears against a Muslim ninth-grader in Texas who was wrongfully arrested for bringing a home-made clock a bomb! to school.
In party-political terms, Islamophobia is now a vote-winner in right-wing Republican circles. How else to explain the number of Republican Party presidential candidates falling over one another to find new and obscene ways to bash Muslims? The campaign has seen Donald Trump call for a ban on Muslims entering the US, Ben Carson refusing to countenance a Muslim president and x201C;moderatex201D; Jeb Bush demanding that the US government focus its support on Christian, rather than Muslim, refugees from Syria.
Push-back
On Wednesday, the commander-in-chief pushed back. Obama loudly denounced x201C;distorted media portrayalsx201D; of Islam and the people x201C;conflating the horrific acts of terrorism with the beliefs of an entire faithx201D;. He condemned the x201C;inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim Americans that has no place in our countryx201D; and drew a causal link between hate speech and violence.

Putting aside some of my own criticisms of Obamaapos;s domestic and foreign policies for a moment, let me say this, on behalf of my Muslim-American daughters and my headscarf-wearing Muslim-American wife, who has been verbally abused on the streets of this nationapos;s capital: thank you, Mr President.
 


x201C;No surprise, then, that threats and harassment of Muslim Americans have surged,x201D; he told his audience in Maryland. x201C;Here at this mosque, twice last year, threats were made against your children.xA0;Around the country, women wearing the hijab x2026; have been targeted. Wex2019;ve seen children bullied. Wex2019;ve seen mosques vandalised.x201D; The first non-white president of the US also had no qualms about identifying the racial component of Islamophobia: x201C;Sikh Americans and others who are perceived to be Muslims have been targeted, as well.x201D;
Dismissing talk of a x201C;clash of civilisations between the West and Islamx201D;, Obama refused to ask Muslim Americans to choose between their identities. x201C;Youx2019;re not Muslim or American,x201D; declaimed the president. x201C;Youx2019;re Muslim and American.x201D;
To which the only sane response from any Muslim, and anyone who claims to care about racial equality or religious liberty, surely has to be: Hallelujah!
Yes, Obama has been silent on the issue of growing Islamophobia for far too long though, to his credit, he did slam Trumpx2019;s anti-Muslim vitriol in his State of the Union speech in January.
Yes, he should have visited a US mosque much earlier in his presidency: it is scandalous that Obamax2019;s trip to the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday was his first appearance at a mosque on US soil since entering the White House a mosque which, as it happens, is less than 50 miles from his Pennsylvania Avenue home.
Bigotry prevails
A belated denunciation of anti-Muslim bigotry from the president of the US, in front of a Muslim audience in a mosque, is a denunciation nevertheless. A much-needed denunciation from the most important public figure in the land. Would some of his Muslim critics, I wonder, prefer it if he had not given the speech?
In fact, given the rise of Trump and the fallout from the massacre in San Bernardino, California, Obamax2019;s timing, ironically and unwittingly, couldnx2019;t have been better. x201C;Coming to a mosque is a public reminder that Muslims have been part of America since our nationx2019;s founding,x201D; Farhana Khera of Muslim Advocates told CNN in the run-up to the event.

INTERACTIVE:xA0;American Muslims speak out

A public reminder in an era in which, as the president himself openly acknowledged and the statistics clearly demonstrate, there has been a surge in the number of attacks on Muslims and mosques in the US.
A public reminder, to quote Obama, that x201C;an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths,x201D; especially in the midst of a Republican primary campaign in which proudly Christian candidates rush to smear and stigmatise Muslims. Marco Rubio, incidentally, claimed Obamax2019;s mosque visit was another example of him x201C;pitting people against each otherx201D;; Trump sneered that the president x201C;feels comfortable therex201D;.
Mere rhetoric?
As I have arguedxA0;elsewhere, Obamax2019;s own official statements andxA0;policies on counterterrorism and civil liberties issues have been far from perfect. From NSA spying on Muslim Americans to drone strikes in Pakistan, from anti-Muslim profiling at US airports to support for Israelx2019;s bombardment of Gaza, the president has undoubtedly upset, frustrated and angered millions of Muslims at home and abroad.
Some might justifiably argue that his administrationx2019;s militarism and surveillance helped to incite the fear of, and hatred towards, Muslim Americans that he so eloquently rebuked in his speech on Wednesday.
Cynics, therefore, may dismiss Obamax2019;s mosque speech as mere rhetoric. But rhetoric matters. Those who argue that the presidentx2019;s speech wonx2019;t, or canx2019;t, have an impact are either naive or disingenuous.

As Christopher Smith, ofxA0;Claremont University,xA0;has demonstrated, one of the best ways to combat anti-Muslim bigotry is a x201C;bipartisan effort by government and media to avert discrimination by framing Islam in a positive wayx201D;.
It may indeed be depressing and disturbing that, in 2016, the US president feels compelled to make a speech reminding Muslim Americans that x201C;youx2019;re right where you belong. Youx2019;re part of America, toox201D;. But, to be honest, Ix2019;m glad he did. And I also worry whether the next president will even bother.



At the very beginning of his address at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, Obama told his audience that he wanted to say x201C;two words that Muslim Americans donx2019;t hear often enough x2013; and that is, thank you.x201D;
x201C;Thank you for serving your community,x201D; he continued. x201C;Thank you for lifting up the lives of your neighbours, and for helping keep us strong and united as one American family.x201D;
So, putting aside some of my own criticisms of Obamax2019;s domestic and foreign policies for a moment, let me say this, on behalf of my Muslim-American daughters and my headscarf-wearing Muslim-American wife, who has been verbally abused on the streets of this nationx2019;s capital: thankxA0;you, Mr President.xA0;Thank you for standing up to anti-Muslim bigotry and racial demagoguery; thank you for challenging the x201C;New McCarthyismx201D; that is Islamophobia.
Better late than never.
