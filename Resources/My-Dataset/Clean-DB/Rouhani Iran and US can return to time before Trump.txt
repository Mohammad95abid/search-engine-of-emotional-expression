Tehran, Iran x2013; Iran and the United States can fully reverse four years of Donald Trump and return to conditions before his presidency, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said.
In a televised cabinet speech on Wednesday, Rouhani said if the incoming Joe Biden administration has the political will, Iran-US relations could be very different.
x201C;Iran and the US can both decide and announce that they will return to conditions on January 20, 2017,x201D; he said.
x201C;This can be a great solution to a large number of issues and completely change the path and conditions.x201D;
However, Rouhani outlined what Iran would expect of future President Biden.
x201C;We hope that in its first steps, the next US administration will explicitly condemn Trumpx2019;s policies on Iran,x201D; the president said, calling the policies x201C;anti-human rights and terroristicx201D;.
He also said a Biden administration would have to x201C;make up for the incorrect policiesx201D; of his predecessor without further elaborating.















The president said Iranx2019;s policy has always been clear and is based on x201C;commitment for commitment, action for action, de-escalation for de-escalation, and respect for respectx201D;.
In May 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers in 2015 and imposed harsh economic sanctions on Tehran.
The sanctions only intensified as Iran started battling the deadliest outbreak COVID-19 pandemic of the Middle East, which has now killed nearly 50,000 people.
Iran has called the x201C;maximum pressurex201D; campaign of the Trump administration an instance of x201C;economic and medical terrorismx201D;, and has said a future US administration would have to pay compensation.
x2018;End of Trumpismx2019;
The Iranian president on Wednesday also said the defeat of Trump in the US presidential elections signals that Iranians emerged victorious from an x201C;economic warx201D;.
x201C;One of the great manifestations of the victory of the Iranian nation and the certain defeat of the enemy in this economic war is the end of the Trumpism era,x201D; Rouhani said.
x201C;This person committed the worst crimes in US history against independent nations, especially the Iranian and Palestinian nations.x201D;
According to Rouhani, the past three years signal a new x201C;holy defencex201D; only second to the deadly eight-year Iran-Iraq War that ended in 1988.
In both wars, he said, Iran stood alone while foes supported from both the West and the east attacked.
Rouhanix2019;s remarks come one day after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran will resist and choose the path of x201C;defusing sanctions and overcoming themx201D; until a time when countries that target Iran come to the realisation that sanctions are useless.
x201C;We tried the path of lifting sanctions once and negotiated for years, but it led to no results,x201D; Khamenei said.
x201C;If we can overcome sanctions through hard work and innovation and taking problems as they come, and the other side sees that sanctions are ineffective, they will gradually stop sanctioning.x201D;
