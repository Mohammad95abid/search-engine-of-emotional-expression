It had reportedxA0;days earlier that Mubarak was suffering from x201C;chronic infections in the gallbladderx201D;.
The report was unusual as discussion of the presidentx2019;s health is usually a taboo subject inxA0;Egypt.
x2018;Concern to manyx2019;
Samer Shehata, an Egyptian professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera that sincexA0;Egypt has no vice-president, news of Mubarakx2019;s surgery becomes x201C;a concern to many Egyptians and many outside the country if it does not go wellx201D;.

Mubarak dodges presidency question







x201C;Whenever there is a health issue with thexA0;president, all of a sudden questions of succession rise to the forefront of Egyptian politics, tremendous speculation, some concern and anxiety, and this is just one of those examples,x201D; he said.
Mubarakx2019;s fifth six-year term as president will end in 2011 andxA0;press reports in Egypt have suggested that his son Gamal is likelyxA0;to succeed him.
Neither Mubarak nor his son have made any clear statements on the matter.
x201C;The succession issue is one of the most hotly contested issues in Egypt right now. For good reason, itx2019;s tied into the issue of democratisation and reform and so on,x201D; Shehata said.
Succession concerns
Rawya Rageh, Al Jazeerax2019;s correspondent in Cairo, said that both the x201C;timing and the announcement were significantx201D;.
x201C;This, of course, is an election year in Egypt. Wex2019;re expecting parliamentary elections later this yearxA0;followed by presidential elections in 2011,x201D; she said.
x201C;President Hosni Mubarak has, of course, never appointed a vice-president and the issue of succession has always loomed over his presidency.xA0;
x201C;All this comes at a time when the country is witnessing a heated political debate with the return of the former head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, who has spoken a lot about reforms in Egypt; about the ability of independent candidates to run as presidential candidates for next yearx2019;s election.x201D;
The IAEA is the UNx2019;s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency and ElBaradei, its former head, has said he could stand for president, but only if certain constitutional changes are made.
Health scare
Mubarak has said that ElBaradei could run for the presidency, provided he respects the constitution.
Under Egyptian law, a presidential candidate is required to have been a leading member of a party for at least one year and for the party to have existed for at least five years.
ElBaradei, who established the National Association for Change after he returned to Cairo last month has proved popular among Egyptians and enjoys a high profile internationally.
Murbarakx2019;s health has been a concernxA0;in the past. In 2007,xA0;rumours aboutxA0;his poorxA0;health werexA0;rife toxA0;the extent thatxA0;he was promptedxA0;to make an unscheduled public appearance to dispel them.
One year later, Ibrahim Eissa, the editor-in-chief of the independent daily al-Dustur, was sentenced to two months in jail after his newspaper published rumours on Mubarakx2019;s health,xA0;although he was later granted a presidential pardon.
