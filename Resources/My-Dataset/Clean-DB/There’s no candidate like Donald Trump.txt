There has never been a presidential candidate like Donald Trump.
He inspires and frightens the Republican Party in almost equal measure. While his poll numbers continue to tick upwards, Republican operatives are planning a campaign to try to take him down. 
Theyx2019;re attracting big-money investors for a series of attack ads aimed at derailing a campaign many thought would have hit the buffers long before now.
But therex2019;s a concern that there is nothing they can do to stop him because the rules donx2019;t seem to apply to x201C;The Donaldx201D;.
Hex2019;s dominated the headlines in recent days because of his anti-Muslim comments. And itx2019;s worth taking a few minutes to look at how thatx2019;s unfolded.
On Thursday, in an interview published by Yahoo News he suggested that after the attacks in Paris, there would have to be greater surveillance of Muslims in the US.
He was then asked if that might require registering Muslims in a database, or crucially, presenting them with some form of identification card which listed their religion, in the words of the article.
He didnx2019;t rule that out.
x201C;Wex2019;re going to have to x2013; wex2019;re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,x201D; Trump said when presented with the idea.
x201C;Wex2019;re going to have to look at the mosques. Wex2019;re going to have to look very, very carefully.x201D;
x2018;A lot of systemsx2019;
Later that same day, an American network TV reporter asked Trump: x201C;Should there be a database or system that tracks Muslims in this country?x201D;
Trump replied: x201C;There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. I mean, we should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it. 
x201C;But right now we have to have a border, we have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let whatx2019;s happening in this country happen any longer.x201D; 
The TV reporter pushed on: x201C;But thatx2019;s something your White House would want to implement?x201D; 
To which Trump replied: x201C;Oh, I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.x201D;
The Trump campaign argued that Trump was x201C;absolutely committed to a wall, not a databasex201D;, suggesting that in the tumult of a campaign stop, the candidate misheard the question.xA0;
But the reporter had followed up again and asked if the plan meant going to mosques to sign people up.
To that Trump replied: x201C;Different places. You sign x2019;em up at different, but itx2019;s all about management. Our country has no management.x201D;
From that exchange, itx2019;s clear this was not about a wall.
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, two of the Democratic front-runners, predictably condemned the comments as did Republican rivals Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Ted Cruz.
But perhaps the most telling criticism came from the American Jewish Committee, which called the idea x201C;outrageous and un-Americanx201D;.
Drawing parallels with Nazi Germany and the forced registration of the Jewish people, it said: x201C;What Mr Trump proposes, in this case targeting all Muslims, is a horror movie that we Jews are quite familiar with.x201D;
No reverse gear
For Donald Trump, there appears to be no reverse gear. In the past when confronted with some of the outrageous things he said, there has been no apology, no retraction.xA0;
At campaign stops he blamed the media, claiming the x201C;bloodsuckersx201D; were dishonest about things he said.xA0;
When it came to refugees from Syria, he told one crowd of supporters, x201C;I want surveillance ofxA0;these people. I want surveillance if we have to and I donx2019;t care. I want x2013; are you ready for this, folks? x2013; I want surveillance of certain mosques, OK?x201D;
Asked if he was not ruling out a database of all Muslims , he replied: x201C;No, not at all.x201D;
At a rally on Saturday, Trump added a new line to his anti-Muslim rhetoric, claiming that after the attacks in New York on September 11,xA0;2001, he watched x201C;news footage of thousands and thousands of peoplex201D; celebrating the attack in Jersey City, New Jersey, x201C;wherex201D; in his words x201C;you have a large Arab populationx201D;.



In a TV interview on Sunday, Trump insisted he had seen the footage and that to suggest he hadnx2019;t was simply being x201C;politically correctx201D;, which, along with attacks on the media, is another Trump trope.
So the fact-checkers went to work. And no one could find any footage or any coverage of protests in the place and the time Trump described.
The police said it didnx2019;t happen. People in the area said it didnx2019;t happen.
At the time of the attacks, police rushed to the nearby town of Paterson where they heard there was a large gathering of men in the centre of the cityx2019;s Middle Eastern Community.xA0; xA0;
x201C;When we got there, they were all in prayer,x201D; said the townx2019;s police chief. 
The mayor of Jersey City tweeted his response saying Trump x201C;has memory issues or willfully distorts the truthx201D;.
At his next campaign rally, Trump insisted his office had been bombarded with people calling x201C;hundreds of peoplex201D;, saying they remember the pictures too.
The Washington Post checked out Trumpx2019;s claims and could find anything to support him.
Apology demanded
Concluding Trump lied, its Fact Checker column wrote: x201C;Trump has defamed the Muslim communities of New Jersey. 
x201C;He cannot simply assert something so damning; he must provide some real evidence or else issue an apology.x201D;
But with his crowds growing, his poll numbers rising and the possibility he may actually win the Republican nomination, Trump continues to defy expectations and to defy conventional wisdom.
The negative publicity seems to fuel the candidate and rile up his base support. It seems no matter what he says; his crowds donx2019;t care.xA0; 
The suggestion hex2019;s making up policy on the hoof doesnx2019;t seems to matter.
He continues to win support.
Thatx2019;s what continues to worry the Republican Party establishment and why Donald Trump is no ordinary candidate.
