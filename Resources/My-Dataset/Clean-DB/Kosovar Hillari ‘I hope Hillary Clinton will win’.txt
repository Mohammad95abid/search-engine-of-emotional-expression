Pristina, Kosovo x2013; In Europex2019;s newest capital, where the Stars and Stripes are prominently displayed outside buildings and boulevards are named after famous US and British politicians, one stands out from the mix: Bill Clinton Boulevard. There is even a womenx2019;s clothing boutique here that sells red and blue pantsuits called x201C;Hillaryx201D; that was visited by the former secretary of state in 2010.
Seventeen years after the Kosovo war with Serbia, support for the Clintons has not wavered in the tiny Balkan nation that still credits the US for liberating the country from Serbia after leading NATOx2019;s efforts to remove Slobodan Milosevicx2019;s forces from Kosovo.xA0;

Tomorrow is going to be Americax2019;s biggest elections and there are a lot of reasons why these elections are important for us. I am studying political science and I want to keep on going to pursue gender studies and thatx2019;s why I was reading all the time about Hillary and these elections.
It feels really good to have a woman as a candidate.

It means a lot to me as a Kosovar and as a young girl because she gives me hope that I can keep studying and I can be an important person just like her. Knowing that she is older than I am, that means that she went through a lot of problems. Women were not always in good positions in politics and economics and all the fields but she made it through.xA0;
Knowing that she made it through all this, why canx2019;t I make it through?
Living in a country like Kosovo is pretty hard, we know what people think here x2013; the mentality of old people especially x2013; and this makes me believe that I can do what I want to do and that I can achieve my dreams. This is why I really would love to see her winning the election.

I didnx2019;t imagine that I would have so many emotions.xA0;

I think that this special woman deserves the victory and letx2019;s hope that wex2019;ll soon see her as the next president in the White House. This is a historical event for the US, meaning that this will be the first time that the US will the ruled by a woman. I believe that she has potential and experience in politics to rule a country.
When she will finally have the presidential post, all her potential will rise to the surface.xA0;
She truly deserves this post. I hope with all my heart that she will win.
We are linked with this situation Hillary Clintonx2019;s candidacy since the beginning the family-run Hillary boutiques that started in 2002, after the end of the war. This link is now more connected, that is why I am so emotional, also because of her visit to the store, also with her popularity, itx2019;s linked.

I think that Donald does all of this only to create noise, itx2019;s not like he will do the things that he pretends to do.
Of course the majority of the Muslims are pro-Hillary because shex2019;s more pro-Islam than Donald. I observe the situation from the religious perspective x2013; the Muslim perspective. Donald is a little bit crazy.

I hope Hillary will win and we also wonx2019;t forget that she is Billx2019;s wife.
I think that shex2019;ll be better than Bill, shex2019;s a complete woman as we say here, and you can tell that she has political experience. She knows that field, shex2019;s been a member of American politics and itx2019;s nothing new for her. I think that she can easily deal with it and also make it as president.
Of course in the US you donx2019;t have to promise roads and build apartment blocks as our politicians do here, because all of those things already exist over there. But there in the US you have to come up with something dramatic to get the attention of the people, to attract the people to be more interested in you, and to lead the people in believing that maybe the situation could change. This is the method that Donald Trump is using.
Even if he comes to power he wonx2019;t do the majority of the things that he promised.

I am Hillari Alidema, I was born in January 1995. My grandfather named me, which was before the war and what makes my story kind of interesting.xA0;

I feel very good that I hold the name of Mrs Hillary and I feel privileged. Of course shex2019;s an inspiration for me to move forwards in education and everything else in life.
I believe that she has to win because shex2019;s worthy and the most prepared person to lead a world superpower like the US.
I have her name and the elections are very important because for the next four years, the good relations between Kosovo and the US would continue.
