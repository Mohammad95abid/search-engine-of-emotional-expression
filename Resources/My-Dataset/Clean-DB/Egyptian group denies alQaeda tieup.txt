x201C;The Gamaa Islamiya in Egypt stresses the lack of truth in what Aljazeera aired by Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri about it joining al-Qaeda, and categorically denies this,x201D; the groupxA0;said in a statement on its website.

And a former official in Egyptx2019;s Gamaa Islamiya said that even if some members had joined al-Qaeda x2013;xA0;as al-Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri said in a video aired on Aljazeera on Saturday x2013;xA0;it was unlikely that most would do so.
The groupxA0;fought a bloody campaign against the government in the 1990s to set up an Islamic state beforexA0;declaring a truce in 1997.
Sheikh Abdel Akher Hammad, a former Gamaa leader, told Aljazeera on Sunday from Germany: x201C;If some brothers x2026; have joined, then this is their personal view and I donx2019;t think that most Gamaa Islamiya members share that same opinion.x201D;
No al-Qaeda support
Egypt analysts have downplayed al-Zawahirix2019;s announcement that a x201C;big factionx201D; of the Gamaa had switched over, saying there was no evidence al-Qaeda had major support within the groupx2019;sxA0;ranks.
In the video, al-Zawahiri named Mohamed al-Islambouli as one of those who joined al-Qaeda, referring to the Gamaa leader whose brother Khaled killed Anwar Sadat, the then Egyptian president, in 1981.
A man introduced by al-Zawahiri as another Gamaa leader, Mohamed Hakaima, later appeared in the video to confirm the unity move. But several analysts said he was not a major player.
Diaa Rashwan,xA0;a specialist on Islamist groups at the al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, said Hakaima x201C;doesnx2019;t represent anybody here in the countryx201D;,xA0;describing him as a x201C;low-ranking memberx201D; of the group.
Egypt detained many thousands of Gamaa members or sympathisers in the 1990s when the group was waging a low-level guerrilla war against security forces, mainly in the south.
But hundreds have since come out of detention after renouncing violence. Gamaa leaders declared a truce after a deadly 1997 attack on tourists inxA0;Luxor.
Analysts said they did not expect any change in the groupx2019;s policy after the al-Qaeda announcement, saying its leadership had clearly chosen to avoid violence in Egypt.
