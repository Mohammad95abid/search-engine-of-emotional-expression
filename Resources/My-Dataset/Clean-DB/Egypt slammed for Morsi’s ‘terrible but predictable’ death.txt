A human rights group says the Egyptian government bears responsibility for thexA0;death of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, amid pressing international demands for a fair and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his final hours.
According to authorities, the first democratically elected president in Egyptx2018;s modern history died on Monday after collapsing in a court in Cairo while on trial on espionage charges. The Egyptian public prosecutor said a medical report showed no apparent recent injuries on Morsix2019;s body.
The 67-year-old, whoxA0;had been behind bars for nearly six years after his overthrow in a military coup in 2013,xA0;had a long history of health issues, including suffering from diabetes, as well as liver and kidney disease.
 Rights groups and international observers had long decried the medical neglect Morsi was suffering during his x201C;harshx201D; imprisonment, including years of solitary confinement.
x201C;The government of Egypt today bears responsibility for his death, given their failure to provide him with adequate medical care or basic prisoner rights,x201D; Human Rights Watch HRW said in a statement to Al Jazeera.
x201C;Hex2019;s been in prison and treated worse than the already terrible conditions for Egyptx2019;s prisoners,x201D;xA0;Sarah Leah Whitson,xA0;executive director of the HRWx2019;s Middle East and North Africa division, told Al Jazeera, decryingxA0;Morsix2019;s x201C;terrible but entirely predictablex201D; death.
x201C;The Egyptian government has known very clearly about his declining medical state. He had lost a great deal of weight, he had fainted in court a number of times and was being kept in almost around-the-clock solitary confinement.x201D;

BREAKING x2013; Egypt news says only democratically elected Pres Morsy has died in prison after stroke. This is terrible but ENTIRELY predictable, given govt failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits. hrw was just finalizing a report on his health.

HRWx2019;s statement echoed a report released in March 2018 by axA0;panel of British members of parliament and lawyers,xA0;which warned that the lack of medical treatment could result in Morsix2019;s x201C;premature deathx201D;.

x201C;Our conclusions are stark,x201D; Crispin Blunt, chairman of the Independent Detention Review Panel,xA0;said at the time.
x201C;The denial of basic medical treatment to which he is entitled could lead to his premature death,x201D; he added.
x201C;The whole overseeing chain of command up to the current president would have responsibility for this.x201D;
The members of the panel were denied access by Egyptian authorities to visit Morsi, and relied on testimonies, witness statements, NGO reports and independently submitted evidence.
They said that Morsi was being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, which would be classified as torture under UN guidelines.
x201C;He has been held under conditions that we found on the balance of probability was actually so bad x2013; in terms of how degrading they were and how tough they were for him x2013; that they could amount to torture,x201D; Blunt told Al Jazeera on Monday.
x201C;Torture is a crime of universal jurisdiction. And we found that the responsibility for that would sit all the way up the Egyptian chain of command,x201D; he added. x201C;So, if they had looked after him since our report, then it would be in Egyptx2019;s own interest to establish an independent inquiry.x201D;xA0;
Also on Monday, Amnesty International urged the Egyptian authorities x201C;to conduct an impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances of Morsix2019;s death, including his solitary confinement and isolation from the outside worldx201D;
It also called for a probe into the medical care Morsi was receiving, and for anyone found responsible for mistreatment to be held accountable.
x2018;Unlawful isolationx2019;
The calls came two years after the HRW reported that Egyptian authorities had unlawfully isolated Morsi, preventing him from contacting or receiving visits from his family and lawyers since the military coup in 2013.
On June 4, 2017, Egyptian authorities allowed Morsi to receive visits from his family and lawyer for only the second time in nearly four years, according to the HRW.
These conditions undermined Morsix2019;s right x201C;to mount a legal challenge to his detention and a defence against the many prosecutions filed against himx201D; and may have contributed to a decline in his health, HRW noted.

Herex2019;s what we said TWO years ago about Egypt Pres Morsy cruel and inhumane imprisonment on trumped up BS charges, solitary confinement, deprived of family visits and medical care. Nothing improved. Predictable outcome of govtx2019;s criminal negligence. https://t.co/TEm2mEEBPK

x201C;Morsix2019;s treatment is a window into the appalling conditions suffered by thousands of political detainees in Egypt,x201D; Joe Stork, HRWx2019;s deputy director of Middle East and North Africa, said at the time.
According to the report, during the first week of June in 2017, Morsi fainted twice and experienced a diabetic coma.
A relative of Morsi told HRW in 2015 that a prison nurse or doctor usually checks the former presidentx2019;s blood pressure and sugar level every few days but provided no other healthcare.

The relative said the authorities had never allowed the family to deliver any food or medicine x2013; as most relatives of prisoners do to supplement the often dangerously meagre provisions in Egyptian prisons x2013; and that Morsi had been buying his own insulin using money deposited by his family.
The authorities had also denied Morsi any access to newspapers, television and phone calls, the relative added.
In October 2018, Morsix2019;s son, Abdullah, was arrested days after he told The Associated Press news agency in an interview that his fatherx2019;s health had deteriorated due to prison conditions and that the family was rarely allowed to visit.
Abdullah said he was seeking more visitation rights and better healthcare for his ailing father.
