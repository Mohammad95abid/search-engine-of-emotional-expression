President Donald Trumpx2019;s medical team said on Sunday his health x201C;continues to improvex201D;, and that he could be discharged on Monday.
Trump had also been given dexamethasone, a steroid, after his blood oxygen level dipped, what one expert called an x201C;extremely worrying signx201D;.
Trump said in a recorded message on Saturday that he was feeling ill when he arrived at the Walter Reed medical centre but now feels better.
The president was moved to the military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, for treatment on Friday after testing positive for COVID-19.
Trumpx2019;s diagnosis forced him to withdraw at least temporarily from the campaign, raising questions about its potential effects on the November 3 election.

A White House spokesperson said the Dr Sean Conley, Trumpx2019;s physician, wanted to x201C;project confidencex201D; when he gave a positive outlook of Trumpx2019;s condition, which was minutes later contradicted the by presidentx2019;s chief of staff.
x201C;When youx2019;re treating a patient, you want to project confidence, you want to lift their spirits and that was the intent,x201D; White House communications director Alyssa Farah told reports on Sunday, when asked about the contradiction.
x201C;But chief of staff Mark Meadows came out to give you guys more information just to try to be as transparent as we can,x201D; she said.

Despite the White House medical teamx2019;s positive prognosis, Dr Eric Feigl Ding, an epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, told Al Jazeera that Trump being given dexamethasone is x201C;a extremely worrying signx201D;.
x201C;The WHO World Health Organization says it is only used for critical and severe patients. It actually recommends against usage in people who are not serious,x201D; he said. x201C;NIH National Institutes of Health also says it only for serious patients who are either on ventilators or supplemental oxygen, which Trump barely qualifies for.x201D;
Feigl Ding added that Trump is on a x201C;really bad trajectoryx201D; and that Monday is x201C;a little premature for dischargex201D;.
However, he added: x201C;The White House has a whole surgical unit so being discharged tomorrow Monday is pretty meaningless.x201D;

However, within minutes, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows gave reporters a less rosy assessment, saying, x201C;The presidentx2019;s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. Wex2019;re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.x201D;
Conley commented on the contradictory assessments on Sunday.
x201C;I was trying to reflect an upbeat attitude of the team and the president about the course his illness has had,x201D; Conley told reporters on Sunday. x201C;I didnx2019;t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction and in doing so, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which isnx2019;t necessarily true.x201D;

x201C;I spoke with the Chief of Staff Mark Meadows this morning and the good news is the president feels very well and he actually wants to get back home to the White House and get back to work, but I think hex2019;s going to stay at Walter Reed for at least another period of time,x201D; Ox2019;Brien said on the CBS Face the Nation programme.
Ox2019;Brien, who himself had coronavirus over the summer, said the seventh and eighth days x201C;are the critical days so I think the doctors want to make sure that theyx2019;re there for the president.x201D;
Asked if there had been discussions on transfer of power should Trump become incapacitated, Ox2019;Brien said, x201C;No, thatx2019;s not something thatx2019;s on the table at this point.x201D; He said he would not address hypotheticals but, x201C;We have plans for everything.x201D;

Democrat Joe Biden opened his widest lead in a month in the US presidential race after President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and a majority of Americans think Trump could have avoided infection if he had taken the virus more seriously, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.

Among those adults who are expected to cast ballots in the November 3 election, the poll found that 51 percent were backing Biden, while 41 percent said they were voting for Trump. Another 4 percent were choosing a third-party candidate and another 4 percent said they were undecided.
