United States President Barack Obamax2019;s commendation of the popularity of the heavy metal music genre in Finland has gone viral on social media.
Obamax2019;s remarks came on Friday as he hosted the leaders of European Nordic countries x2013; Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden x2013; at a summit in Washington DC.
Finland has 53 heavy metal bands per 100,000 people, followed by Sweden with 37, while Norway has 27, according to researchxA0;by a Reddit user, who took the listing of bands by country from thexA0; Encyclopaedia MetallumxA0;and calculated the number of bands per 100,000 people using numbers from the CIA World Factbook.xA0;

In his remarks to Finland President Sauli Niinisto, Obama praised the countryx2019;s heavy metal culture and joked about a possible link between the music genre and good governance in the country.
x201C;I do want to point out that Finland has perhaps the most heavy metal bands in the world per capita and also ranks high on good governance. I donx2019;t know if therex2019;s any correlation there.x201D;
Following the remarks, some social media users shared heavy metal style digitally altered pictures of the US president.
Some others posted memes showing Obama as if he is in a mosh pit, a kind of dance carried out by metal and punk rock fans at live shows.

The president also complimented the Nordic countries for technological innovations that wield high influence on todayx2019;s global popular culture.

Obama has frequently expressed his admiration for pragmatic, transparent and liberal-leaning political systems of the Nordic nations while also praising the welfare and educational systems of these countries.

x201C;In fact, in a world of growing economic disparities, Nordic countries have some of the least income inequality in the world,x201D; he added.
x201C;There have been times where I have said, why donx2019;t we just put all these small countries in charge for a while and they could clean things up.x201D;
