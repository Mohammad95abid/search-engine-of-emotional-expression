Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi says he supports the Syrian military x2013; a position at odds with his countryx2019;s Gulf benefactors such as Saudi Arabia.
The former army chief, who has overseen a warming of ties with Syrian President Bashar al-Assadx2019;s main backer Russia, made the comments during an interview aired on Tuesday with Portuguese broadcaster RTP.
