Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has told the countryx2019;sxA0;senior judges that he did not infringe on their authority when he seized near absolute powers.
An aide to Morsi said the decree was limited to x201C;sovereignty-related issues,x201D; but that did not satisfy his critics.
The uncompromising stance came duringxA0;Mondayx2019;s meeting between Morsi and members of the Supreme Judiciary Council in a bid to resolve a four-day crisis that has plunged the country into a new round of turmoil with clashes between the two sides that have left one protester dead and hundreds wounded.
The judiciary, the main target of Morsix2019;s edicts, also has pushed back, calling the decrees a power grab and an x201C;assaultx201D; on the branchx2019;s independence. 
Judges and prosecutors stayed away from many courts in Cairo and other cities on Sunday and Monday.
Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood has called off a mass demonstration in Cairo, originallyxA0;planned for Tuesday, x201C;until futher noticex201D; in order to x201C;avoid clashesx201D;.

Activists on Monday were camped in Cairox2019;s Tahrir Square for a fourth day, blocking traffic with makeshift barricades to protest against what they said was a power-grab by Morsi. Nearby, riot police and protesters clashed intermittently.
Mona Amer, spokesman for the opposition movement Popular Current, said Tuesdayx2019;s protest would go on.
x201C;We asked for the cancellation of the decree and that did not happen,x201D; she said.
Before the presidentx2019;s announcement, leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahy said protests would continue until the decree was scrapped and said Tahrir would be a model of an x201C;Egypt that will not accept a new dictator because it brought down the old onex201D;.
Temporary measures
Morsix2019;s office repeated assurances that the measures would be temporary, and said he wanted dialogue with political groups to find x201C;common groundx201D; over what should go in Egyptx2019;s constitution, one of the issues at the heart of the crisis.
Hassan Nafaa, a professor of political science at Cairo University, saw an effort by the presidency and judiciary to resolve the crisis, but added their statements were x201C;vaguex201D;.
x201C;The situation is heading towards more trouble,x201D; he said.
Sundayx2019;s stock market fall of nearly ten per cent x2013; halted only by automatic curbs x2013; was the worst since the uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak in February, 2011.
x201C;We are back to square one, politically, socially,x201D; said Mohamed Radwan of Pharos Securities, an Egyptian brokerage firm.
Morsix2019;s decree marks an effort to consolidate his influence after he successfully sidelined Mubarak-era generals in August, andxA0;reflects his suspicions of a judiciary little reformed since the fall of his predecessor.
Issued just a day after Morsi received glowing tributes from Washington for his work brokering a deal to end eight days of Israeli attacks on Gaza, the decree drew warnings from the West to uphold democracy.

The Morsi administration has defended his decree as an effort to speed up reforms that will complete Egyptx2019;s democratic transformation.

But hisxA0;calls for dialogue have been rejected by members of the National Salvation Front, a new opposition coalition of liberals, leftists and other politicians and parties, who until Morsix2019;s decree had been a fractious bunch struggling to unite.
The Front includes Sabahy, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohamed ElBaradei and former Arab League chief Amr Moussa.
The military has stayed out of the crisis after leading Egypt through a messy 16-month transition to a presidential election in June.
Analysts say Morsi neutralised the army when he sacked top generals in August, appointing a new generation who now owe their advancement to the president.
Though the military still wields influence through business interests and a security role, it is out of frontline politics.
x201C;There is no room for dialogue when a dictator imposes the most oppressive, abhorrent measures and then says x2018;let us split the differencex2019;,x201D; ElBaradei said on Saturday.
Morsi framed his decisions on Thursday as necessary to protect the revolution that toppledxA0;Mubarak nearly two years ago and to cement the nationx2019;s transition to democratic rule.
Morsi also ordered the retrial of Mubarak and top aides on charges of killing protesters during the uprising.
x201C;He had to act to save the country and protect the course of the revolution,x201D; Pakinam al-Sharqawi, one of Morsix2019;s aides, said.
x201C;It is a major stage in the process of completing the January 25th revolution,x201D; she said, alluding to the starting day of last yearx2019;s uprising against Mubarak.
He also created a new x201C;protection of the revolutionx201D; judicial body to swiftly carry out the prosecutions.
