US Democrats opened the second night of their convention with voices from across the partyx2019;s politic divide. Moderates like John Kerry and progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will made appearances.


Response to the first night was positive from many Democratic loyalists, but some criticised its lack of policy proposals and time given to prominent Republicans supporting Biden.


Two former US presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, spoke. Carter, an elderly one-term president, is widely respected. Clinton is remembered fondly by many, though his association with convicted paedophile Jeffery EpsteinxA0;has caused some controversy, thoughxA0;no allegations of impropriety have been levelled against Clinton.


Jill Biden, wife of presumptive nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden, delivered the final speech highlighting their familyx2019;s struggle after Biden accepted the nomination.

Herex2019;s what happened:

While welcomed by many, the newest endorsement x2013; and time alloted to Powell to do so x2013; will likely upset members of the progressive wing of the party. One of its rising stars, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, will receive one minute for a pre-recorded statement tonight.
Some commentators, including Rebecca Traister, have equated the prominence given to Republicans during the DNC to x201C;self-sabotage.x201D;
The x201C;relegation of Ocasio-Cortez, who electrifies multiple parts of a Democratic base, to one meager minute, a segment that x2026; isnx2019;t just a snubx201D;, Traister wrote in The Cut. x201C;The failure of a major political party to showcase one of its most talented politicians, a young person whose communicative reach and facility positions her to be among its leaders deep into our future, is self-sabotage.
23:05 GMT x2013; Cindy McCain, wife of late Republican Senator John McCain, set to speak
Cindy McCain will lend her voice to a video set to air during Tuesday nightx2019;s Democratic National Convention programming focused on Bidenx2019;s close friendship with her late husband, Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, though it isnx2019;t expected to be an outright endorsement.
In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidensx2019; backyard.

McCain is the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials x2013; including former Ohio Governor John Kasich x2013; endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night.
Itx2019;s a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention -an effort to broaden the partyx2019;s appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.xA0;
22:02 GMT x2013; Jill Biden to get personal about familyx2019;s struggles
Jill Biden will offer a personal glimpse into her familyx2019;s struggles and vouch for her husbandx2019;s ability to lead the nation through adversity during her opening remarks at the Democratic National Convention.

During their decades in public life, Jill and Joe Biden have faced considerable personal loss. Shortly after getting elected as a senator in 1972, Bidenx2019;s first wife and infant daughter were killed in a crash, leaving him to raise his two sons alone.
Biden married Jill about four years later, but the two faced tragedy together when Bidenx2019;s son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015.
Both speak openly on the campaign trail about the challenges theyx2019;ve experienced, and Jill Biden will speak about what it takes to x201C;make a broken family wholex201D;.
x201C;The same way you make a nation whole. With love and understanding x2013; and with small acts of compassion.x201D;

The record confirms, according to a widely accepted definition, that Wall Streetx2019;s most closely followed index entered a bull market after hitting its pandemic low on March 23.
The news should be welcome for Trump, who is trailing Biden in most national polls but has campaigned on the strength of the economy prior to the coronavirus crisis.
21:20 GMT x2013; Embattled postmaster general pauses controversial changes to mail delivery
US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Tuesday suspended all mail service changes until after the November election after an outcry by Democrats about concerns the changes were an attempt to bolster President Donald Trumpx2019;s chances in the November polls.
x201C;To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded,x201D; DeJoy, a Trump ally and consistent donor to the Republican Party, said in a statement.

The reversal follows complaints that the cuts could slow the handling of mail-in ballots, which could account for as many as half of all votes cast in Novemberx2019;s election as the coronavirus pandemic raises fears of crowds.
xA0;20:50 GMT x2013; Trump responds to Obamax2019;s criticism
Trump, the object of much ire during the first night of the Democratic National Convention, responded to the stinging attack from former First Lady Michelle Obama delivered on the first night.
Obama said Trump was x201C;in over his head x2026; it is what it isx201D; in an apparent reference to Trumpx2019;s own comments on the US death toll due to the coronavirus pandemic.
x201C;Somebody please explain to Michelle ObamaxA0;that Donald J Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it werenx2019;t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama,x201D; the president tweeted on Tuesday, calling Biden an x201C;afterthoughtx201D;.
