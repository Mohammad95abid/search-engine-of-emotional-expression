x201C;Thanks to you, wex2019;ve reached a milestone,x201D; she said at a rally in New York, before taking aim at her likely Republican competitor, Donald Trump.
Clinton told supporters in New York that Trump was x201C;temperamentally unfitx201D; to be president, citing Trumpx2019;s attacks on a federal judge, reporters and women.
x201C;He wants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt in wounds and reminding us daily just how great he is,x201D; Clinton said.
x201C;Well, we believe we should lift each other up, not tear each other down.x201D;
Sanders has vowed to continue his campaign to next weekx2019;s primary in Washington DC and further to the convention held in Philadelphia on July 25.
x201C;The fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight but we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate,x201D; he told a rally in Santa Monica, California.

 Bernie Sanders vows to stay in Democrat nomination race 
Clinton declaration of victory comes a day after the Associated Press announced she was the presumptive Democratic nominee based on a count of elected pledged delegates and unelected superdelegates.
The Sanders campaign rejected that announcement as premature and said it would continue to campaign in California.
In an interview with NBC News, Sanders expressed concern that the news of Clintonx2019;s victory came the night before x201C;the largest primaryx201D; and that it was based on what he described as x201C;anonymousx201D; commitments from superdelegates, who vote at the Democratic convention in late July.
x201C;They got on the phone, as I understand it, and started hounding superdelegates to tell them in an anonymous way who they were voting for,x201D;xA0;he said.
x201C;The night before the largest primary, biggest primary in the whole process, they make this announcement.
x201C;So I was really disappointed in what The AP did.x201D;
Sanders is set to meet Obama at the White House on Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.
