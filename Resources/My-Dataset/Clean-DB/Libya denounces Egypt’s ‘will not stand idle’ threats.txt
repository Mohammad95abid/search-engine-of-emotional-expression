Libya has condemned the Egyptian president for recent comments suggesting Cairo x201C;will not stand idlex201D; against threats to national security and could arm Libyan tribes against the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.
During a meeting in Cairo with tribal leaders from the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Thursday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said Egypt x201C;will not stand idle in the face of any moves that pose a direct threat to the national security not only of Egypt but also that of Libyax201D; and the region, according to a presidency statement.
In response, the Government of National Accordx2019;s GNA Foreign Ministry spokesperson criticised the statement as x201C;blatant interference in Libyan internal affairsx201D;.
x201C;El-Sisix2019;s talk is a repeat of his previous statements, which is a blatant interference in Libyan affairs,x201D; Mohammed al-Qablawi told Al Jazeera,xA0;adding that el-Sisix2019;s speech was x201C;not aimed at peace, as he said, but it is he who is fueling the Libyan conflict.x201D;
The Egyptian presidentx2019;s comments came days after the eastern-based Libyan parliament, aligned with renegade commander Khalifa Haftar, gave in-principle support to a threatened Egyptian military intervention in the country.
In June, el-Sisi suggested that Cairo could launch x201C;external military missionsx201D; into Libya, saying x201C;any direct intervention in Libya has already become legitimate internationallyx201D;.
He threatened to send in his army if GNA forces captured Sirte, located more than 800km 500 miles from the Egyptian border.xA0;

The GNA, which has been pushing to take the strategic city from Haftar, denounced Sisix2019;s statements as a x201C;declaration of warx201D;.xA0;
Libya, a major oil producer, has been mired in chaos since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.
Since 2014, it has been split between rival factions based in Tripoli and in the east, in a sometimes-chaotic war that has drawn in outside powers and a flood of foreign arms and mercenaries.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the GNA is backed by Turkey.xA0;

Haftarx2019;s eastern-based self-styled Libyan National Army has been on the back foot after Turkish support helped the GNA turn back his 14-month assault on the capital, Tripoli.
In June, Cairo proposed a peace initiative calling for a ceasefire, withdrawal of mercenaries and disbanding militias in the neighbouring country.
The GNA and Ankara dismissed the plan, which el-Sisi unveiled with Haftar at his side.
Earlier this month, UNxA0;Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned the United Nations Security Council that the conflict in Libya has entered a new phase x201C;with foreign interference reaching unprecedented levelsx201D;.xA0;
