With President Donald Trump undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at a military hospital, Democratic challenger Joe Bidenx2019;s campaign is looking to keep its focus on the nationx2019;s response to the pandemic in the final month before the presidential election.
Former Vice President Biden, who tested negative on Friday, three days after debating with Trump, has repeatedly wished the president a speedy recovery.
But Biden and his aides have used the presidentx2019;s positive test to underline a consistent campaign message: Biden would handle the pandemic better than Trump.
Deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield on Sunday said Biden would continue to make the case for the remaining 30 days of the campaign that he has x201C;the steady hand to get this country through this crisisx201D;.
x201C;Itx2019;s a choice between two different styles of leadership and since the virus came to our shores back in the spring, Joe Biden has led by example,x201D; she told ABC, citing the campaignx2019;s use of masks, social distancing and limits on the number of people at campaign events. x201C;I think that thatx2019;s what the American people are looking for.x201D;

Trump briefly had an opportunity to pivot the publicx2019;s focus away from COVID-19 when the death last month of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave him the chance to name a third lifetime appointment to the top court before his own illness returned the spotlight to the disease.
Biden is expected on Monday to campaign in Florida, where polls show a tight race to win the statex2019;s crucial 29 electoral college votes.
Voting is already well under way x2013; more than 3.3 million ballots had been cast nationwide by Sunday, according to the Elections Project at the University of Florida x2013; as more Americans vote early or by mail to avoid being exposed to the virus at crowded polling places on Election Day, November 3.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken on October 2-3, after the president tested positive for the coronavirus, found Biden leading Trump by 10 percentage points nationally and nearly two-thirds of Americans thought Trump probably would not have been infected if he had taken the virus more seriously.
Bidenx2019;s campaign has pulled TV and online advertisements attacking Trump, which Bedingfield said reflected the candidatex2019;s belief in x201C;civilityx201D;.
