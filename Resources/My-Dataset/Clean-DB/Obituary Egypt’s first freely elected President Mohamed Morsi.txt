Mohamed Morsi,xA0;Egyptx2019;s first democratically elected president,xA0;has died at the age of 67 after a court appearance in Cairo, according to state media.
A member of the Muslim Brotherhood organisation, Morsi came to office in June 2012 after winningxA0;51.7 percent of the vote in a national election, in the aftermath of Egyptx2019;s 2011 revolution.
However, just one short, roiling year later, Morsix2019;s time in office was cut short in a military takeover amid massive popular protests against his rule.
He was overthrown on July 3, 2013, in axA0;coup staged by current PresidentxA0;Abdel Fattah el-SisixA0;andxA0;placed under house arrest before being moved to prison.
In 2015, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters during demonstrations in 2012.
He was also tried in several different casesxA0;on charges ranging from leaking intelligence information to collaborating with foreign forces to free prisoners from jail in 2011.
In 2016, he was handed a life sentence for espionage in a case related to the Gulf state of Qatar.
He was on trial for a separate espionage charge when he collapsed in court and later died on June 17, 2019.
Early days with the Muslim Brotherhood
Morsi came of political age among the Muslim Brotherhood generation that demonstrated on university campuses in the 1970s, but he was not part of this protesting group.
x201C;He wasnx2019;t a student leader; he joined the Brotherhood relatively late,x201D; said Abdullah al-Arian, assistant professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar who specialises in modern Islamist movements.
x201C;Instead, he was what you might call a loyal member who deferred to the senior leadership, and because of his loyalty was rewarded through continuous promotion.x201D;

Later, Morsi was part of the cohort that wedged a space for the Brotherhood under Hosni Mubarakx2019;s government, earning himself a seat in Parliament in 2000.xA0;
Under Mubarak, the Brotherhood enjoyed what scholar Mona el-Ghobasy calls x201C;de facto tolerationx201D;. But the group occupied an uneasy space in Mubarakx2019;s regime, especially after it won 20 percent of the countryx2019;s parliamentary seats in 2005.
Election fraud denied Morsi another term in Parliament and when Morsi spoke out, participating in a demonstration that supported judges who wanted more independence, he was sentenced to jail for seven months.
Political rise
Born in a conservative town on the Nile Delta, Morsi sketched an interesting political figure. He earned a PhD from a university in California, United States, headed the engineering department at one of Egyptx2019;s biggest universities, and his profile on the Brotherhood website boasted a consulting stint with the NASA space programme perplexingly, Morsi later deniedever having worked there in a local TV interview.

Morsi took strong stances on social practices he viewed as blasphemous.
In 2011, he led a boycott of a major Egyptian mobile phone company because its owner had tweeted cartoon depictions of Minnie Mouse in a face veil.xA0;
Four years earlier, he had been tasked with helping author a position paper for the Guidance Council, the Brotherhoodx2019;s ruling group.
The final mandates included a ban on women and Coptic Christians from serving as president, as well as the formation of a council of Islamic scholars to advise Parliament on the law. Their role would be extra-constitutional, but non-binding.
Bu by 2012, a newly elected Morsi had refined his stance.
x201C;I will not prevent a woman from being nominated as a candidate for the presidency,x201D; he told a New York Times reporter. x201C;This is not in the Constitution. This is not in the law. But if you want to ask me if I will vote for her or not, that is something else, that is different.x201D;

x2018;Man of the peoplex2019;
The Muslim Brotherhood was navigating tricky political space when Morsi became the countryx2019;s first democratically elected president in 2012.
His successful campaign contradicted earlier claims by the Brotherhood that they would not run a presidential candidate.
When Morsi came to office, it was in the aftermath of a revolution, among a highly polarised population that gave him 51.7 percentof the vote.

According to Wael Haddara, one of Morsix2019;s campaign advisers, the president appealed to a public desire for a more accessible leader.
x201C;The counternarrative that Morsi wasnx2019;t a popular person, that Egypt needed a more charismatic figure, was not true x2026; For the first four months, Morsix2019;s popularity ranking was in the stratosphere,x201D; Haddara told Al Jazeera.
x201C;He presented to people an accessible figure. A vast majority of Egyptians eking out a living, struggling to make ends meet, looked at Morsi as one of their own,x201D; he added.
When Morsi swore an informal oath in Tahrir Square, he opened his jacket before supporters to show he wasnx2019;t wearing a bulletproof vest. Upon taking office, one of his first decisions was to order the release of 572 prisoners that had been detained after the revolution by the army.
Morsi himself had been jailed during the 2011 uprising, before escaping in a mass prison break among other Brotherhood leaders and members of Hamas and Hezbollah.

One of Morsiapos;s mistakes during his presidency was that he led people to assume that heapos;d taken the reigns of the state when in fact he hadnapos;t. He was simply put in a position to give people the idea that a real revolution had occurred. The state, meanwhile, was very much in the hands of the same people as it was under Mubarak
Abdullah al-Arian, Georgetown University Assistant Professor of History


Mistakes
Despite the widespread perception of Morsi as a man of the people, Egyptx2019;s new president faced stiff political opposition and the hard ridges of a divisive post-revolutionary society.
The president was officially sworn into office two weeks after the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces SCAF issued an interim declaration, awarding itself all legislative powers and effectively stripping Morsix2019;s office of authority. The lower house of Parliament, with its Brotherhood majority, had also been dissolved by Egyptx2019;s Mubarak-era Supreme Constitutional Court SCC.

The state, meanwhile, was very much in the hands of the same people as it was under Mubarak,x201D; said al-Arian.

As Morsi navigated the political potholes of office, opposition politicians pelted him with criticism for what they saw as dictatorial manoeuvresxA0;to wrangle back power. In August 2012, Morsi nullified the SCAF declaration and put forth one of his own, allotting himself the power to pass laws and select a new constitution-drafting committee.
Morsi promised to forgo these expansive powers after the election of a new parliament, yet some still saw his decision as a political overstep.
The move was coupled with the forced retirement of Mubarak-era senior generals, political strongholds who had been entrenched in Egyptx2019;s elite circles for decades.
x201C;Morsi often talked about the idea that an individual may have an opportunity for change that will come along three times or even four times. You can blow your opportunity and another will come,x201D; said Haddara. x201C;Nations arenx2019;t like that. You may have an opportunity once every generation, and January 25 represented that.x201D;
Though Morsi was mindful of the sacrifices made during the January 2011 uprising before him, his efforts to push the country ahead were often stalled or criticised.
In November 2012, after garnering international goodwill for helping broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Morsi issued a decree that further broadened his executive powers and granted protection to the committee drafting a new constitution. The move was widely seen as a way to shield the committee from challenges by Mubarak-era judges.

x201C;If we did not actually have a constitution, then we would be back to square zero,x201D; said Haddara of the manoeuvre. x201C;Much in the same way that the parliament was dissolved by an organ of the x2018;ancien regimex2019;, the fear here was that this would mean harking back to greater instability for the country.x201D;
Yet, some outraged critics saw the move as unacceptable. By the time he revoked his decision 10 days later, Brotherhood supporters and leftists had already clashed outside the presidential palace in deadly street fights.
x201C;When it comes to politics, itx2019;s all about how you package your decisions as a leader. Morsi could have done a better job at presenting what he was doing. He was indeed trying to fulfil the demands of the revolutionaries, but because he had engendered so much ill-will x2013; especially after a shameless media campaign that constructed an exaggerated image of him x2013; when he finally did something, everyone was outraged,x201D; said al-Arian.
Riddled with walk-outs by liberal, leftist and Mubarak-era politicians, the constitutional drafting process had been portrayed by some critics as an exclusionary endeavour, void of the potential for dialogue. Yet, in a televised address after Novemberx2019;s legal changes, one of Morsix2019;s advisers, Gehad al-Haddad, claimed that the x201C;door is still openx201D;.
Though the president had frequently been criticised for refusing to step outside his trust circle, supporters point to his efforts to be inclusive. In December 2012, Morsix2019;s appointments to the upper house of Parliament had been 75 percent non-Islamist affiliated.
And according to Haddara, throughout Morsix2019;s time in office, his popularity never dipped below 60 to 55 percent.

Yet Morsix2019;s presidency was complicated by the heavy economic frustration weighing on Egyptx2019;s population. The currencyx2019;s value was faltering, and unemployment had ballooned to 13 percent x2013; all the while, Morsi was failing to secure a loan with the IMF.
Haddara notes that, when Morsi came to office, foreign currency reserves had been sapped by SCAF. Even so, gross domestic productxA0;grew from 1.8 percent to 2.2 percent against market prices between 2011 and 2012, and Haddara claims that tourism registered a return to pre-2011 levels.
A mediascape saturated with bias, in which local TV stations were quick to criticise Morsix2019;s policies, labelled Brotherhood supporters as x201C;terroristsx201D;xA0;and cheered on air after the president was arrested, did not help the executive officex2019;s image.
x201C;There were real issues that cannot be minimised x2026; On the other hand, the media exaggerated some of the challenges that were being depicted,x201D; said Haddara, noting the x201C;magical disappearancex201D; of certain social and economic grievances once Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power.
Others complained that Morsix2019;s efforts had bumped against the bureaucracies and entanglements erected by a deep state. Morsix2019;s minister of supply said Egyptx2019;s deep state was activelyworking against him, noting that gas stations raised their prices and did not implement a smart card system designed by Morsi that would have tracked fuel shipments.
























Egypt coup: Five years since Sisi took power






x201C;I donx2019;t think that the Brotherhood ever maintained political power; instead, there was an illusion of power that they played along with,x201D; al-Arian said.
Lambasted for doing too much in the political arena, but too little for gas prices and food security, Morsi attempted to pacify the population in one of his last speeches in June 2013.
x201C;I have made mistakes,x201D; he admitted, but the crowds gathered at Tahrir Square by then did not care for his conciliatory tone.
x2018;Premature death likelyx2019;
By this point, protests both in favour of and against Morsix2019;s removal were rolling across the country. Days later, Morsi was issued an ultimatum by the military to either step down or face a military coup. He was overthrown in the July 2013 coup, and placed under house arrest before being moved to prison.
Within months he went on trial, along with other senior Brotherhood figures, in a case related to the killing of protesters in clashes outside the presidential palace in 2012.
In April 2015, he was sentenced to 20 years on charges of ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in the case, but was acquitted of murder charges.

In September 2016, Morsi was handed a life sentence on charges of passing intelligence to Qatar. And in December 2017, he was also sentenced to three years on charges of insulting the judiciary.
Amnesty International has described Egyptx2019;s judicial system as x201C;horrendously brokenx201D; and called death sentences handed out to Morsi and other members of the Muslim Brotherhood in previous trials a x201C;vengeful march to the gallowsx201D;.
In axA0;reportxA0;released by the Detention Review Panel DRP in March 2018, a panel of British MPs and lawyers warned that Morsix2019;s conditions of imprisonment had left him facing a x201C;premature deathx201D;.
The panel, which was commissioned by Morsix2019;s family, said the former leader was x201C;receiving inadequate medical care, particularlyxA0;inadequate management of his diabetes, and inadequate management of his liver diseasex201D;.xA0;

x201C;The consequence of this inadequate care is likely to be rapid deterioration of his long-term conditions, which is likely to lead to premature death,x201D; it said.
The panel said the conditions of his detention could meet the threshold for torture in Egyptian and international law. It added that el-Sisi x201C;could, in principle, be responsible for the crime of torturex201D;.
He was held at the infamous Tora Prison, also known as Scorpion Prison, where the DRP said he had been held in solitary confinement for about three years.
x201C;The prison was designed so that those who go in donx2019;t come out again unless dead,x201D; said Major General Ibrahim Abd al-Ghaffar, a former Scorpion warden during a TV interview in 2012.
x201C;It was designed for political prisoners.x201D;
