On December 14, 1998, we had a day off at school. As an eight-year-old child, I couldnx2019;t be happier.
All the shops were closed and there were roadblocks everywhere. The streets were filled with Palestinian flags, and white and red striped flags I couldnx2019;t recognise. I asked my father and he explained that those were American flags, and that Bill Clinton, the President of the United States, was going to visit Gaza City later that day.
Little did I know that I would be hearing Clintonx2019;s name almost every day for the next 18 years, but it will not be on happy occasions.
The late Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat, had invited Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton to inaugurate thexA0; Gaza International Airport . Clintonx2019;s helicopters landed on the airportx2019;s runway in Rafah and then took off to Gaza City, where Clinton addressed the Palestinian National Council in what went down in history as the first visit ever by an American president to a x201C;sovereignx201D; Palestinian entity.
 Clintonx2019;s Palestine concerns 
The following year, my siblings and I joined 65 other students in the newly opened American International School in Gaza, a school fully staffed by American and Canadian teachers, with textbooks that had come all the way from the United States to Gaza.

In the meantime, Senator Hillary Clinton joinedxA0;Elie WieselxA0;in addressing x201C;anti-Israelx201D; and x201C;anti-Semiticx201D; rhetoric in Palestinian textbooks PDF . In 2001, shexA0; sent a letter xA0;to President George W Bush urging him to force Yasser Arafat into changing the Palestinian Authorityx2019;s x201C;hateful rhetoricx201D; as a condition for peace.
In 2007, she questioned Mahmoud Abbasx2019; eligibility as a x201C;partner for peacex201D;, given that textbooks issued under his administration were x201C;inciting hatredx201D;.
This came after shexA0; co-sponsored a Congress resolutionxA0;that supported the building of Israelx2019;s apartheid wall in the West Bank, which she defended by saying: x201C;This is not against the Palestinian people, this is against terrorists.x201D;
Despite Clintonx2019;s passionate interest in Palestinian education, she had little praise for Gazax2019;s American school; on the contrary, when two American supplied Israeli F-16 jetsxA0; razed the school xA0;to the ground in 2008/9, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had nothing to say.
Her indifference came as no surprise, and was no different than her reaction, or lack thereof, toxA0;Israelx2019;s destruction of Gazax2019;s AirportxA0;three years after she herself had inaugurated it with Arafat and her husband.
Driven by axA0; mission from God xA0;to spread peace and democracy in the Middle East, Bush pressed for a Palestinian National Council against all odds in 2006. But when Hamas, as predicted, won the elections, hexA0; approved a plan xA0;to overthrow Hamas by igniting a Palestinian civil war with the help of Israel.

In the meantime, Clinton was busyxA0; co-sponsoring a Congress resolution xA0;entitled, x201C;The Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006x201D;. The resolution, which was introduced after Hamas won the elections and taken over Gaza as a result of Bushx2019;s interference, denied Hamas any participation in the x201C;peace processx201D; unless it recognised Israel, disarmed and renounced violence.
The bill was signed into law by Bush in December 2006, and was effectively the approval Israel needed to launch its ongoing siege of Gaza. Effectively, Bush and Clinton tried to change the results of the elections they forced upon us with a violent civil war, and when that failed, they decided to punish us for making the x201C;wrong democratic choicex201D;.
 OPINION: Trump and Israel 
When Hamas won Bushx2019;s elections, I had just graduated from school and was ready to leave Gaza to study at the American University in Cairo. From that year on, crossing the border out of or into Gaza turned into a fine experience of hell on earth.
The US, like any other country on a divinely inspired global peace-promoting mission, had decided to lead an international boycott of Palestine due to the failure of both the elections and the civil war it ignited in tipping the balance of power as it wanted it. The boycott entailed vigorous US support for Israelx2019;s complete imprisonment of the Gaza Stripx2019;s inhabitants with occasional military assaults x2013; three in less than six years.
 Doesnx2019;t matter who is in the White House 
As a student activist campaigning for Palestine in the American University in Cairo , my colleagues and I found ourselves engaging in endless conversations with American study-abroad students, who had a positive opinion about the Bush administrationx2019;s policies towards Palestine, to convince them of the results of the democratic elections that had just brought Hamas to power. After all, these students needed to know the truth before voting in the next US presidential elections in 2008.
Barack Obama was running for office and our hopes were up in the sky, to the extent thatxA0;a group of Palestinians in Gaza joined his campaign overxA0; Skype , hoping that Obamax2019;s victory was going to bring a just solution to their misery. It didnx2019;t.

Hereby, I dedicate Trumpapos;s victory to every democracy-loving American senator, congressman/woman, and campaigner, who gambled with our lives and futures in order to win more AIPAC votes.
 


Stuck in Cairo during the spring break because of the US and Israelx2019;s continuous siege on Gaza, I remember watching Obamax2019;s 2009 speech in Cairo University with mixed feelings.
Despite his attempt to offer a more reconciliatory tone, he had already stated his positions on fundamental Palestinian issues in twoxA0; speeches to AIPAC xA0;x2013; the American Israel Public Affairs Committee x2013; during his campaign: He believed that x201C;Jerusalem will remain the undivided capital of Israelx201D; and was opposed to the right of return.
Hope quickly evaporated as Obamax2019;s eight years in office proved to be no different for the Palestinians, especially those besieged in Gaza.
With Clinton as secretary of state, things got even worse:xA0; in her own words xA0;to the AIPAC, Clinton was an outspoken enemy of BDS the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, a proud opponent of any Palestine-related UN resolutions, a proud condemner of the Goldstone Report, a staunch defender of Israelx2019;s assaults on Gaza, and a major factor behind the US blocking Palestinex2019;s statehood bids at the UN.
When the US announced a plan to provide Israel with $38bn in military aid over the next decade, sealing off Obamax2019;s heroic and peaceful legacy, Clinton expressed her delight inxA0; a statement xA0;congratulating Obama and Netanyahu on this important x201C;diplomatic achievementx201D;. She promised that x201C;as presidentx201D;, she would work to implement this agreement.
Sadly for Clinton, the plan will be implemented without her. She missed a historic opportunity to reaffirm her unwavering support to Israel. But has anyone in the US asked why this plan is the only one that was passed down from Obama to Trump without question? Is sending military aid to Israel more important than Obamacare, for example? Why do the AIPAC and Israel always emerge as victors regardless of who sits in the oval office?
























 Crime spirals amid Israeli siege of Gaza 






As a woman, Ix2019;m deeply offended by Trumpx2019;s victory. As a Palestinian, however, particularly after watchingxA0; Trumpx2019;s speech to the AIPAC , I couldnx2019;t care less who won.
In truth, I stopped caring about American elections once Obama slapped us in the face with staggering indifference to Palestine, which in fact made our lives a living hell.
Hereby, I dedicate Trumpx2019;s victory to every democracy-loving American senator, congressman/woman, and campaigner, who gambled with our lives and futures in order to win more AIPAC votes.
In particular, I dedicate it to Hillary Clinton and her establishment, and to everyone who was distraught by the outcome of the democratic elections that led to Trumpx2019;s victory.
Will Clinton call for boycotting her own people for x201C;making the wrong democratic choicex201D;, will she impose collective punishment on them like she encouraged Israel to do with us? Will she justify the misery that American people will face under Trump like she justified the people of Gazax2019;s suffering under the 2014 Israeli assault byxA0; saying , x201C;theyx2019;re trapped by their leadership, unfortunatelyx201D;?
