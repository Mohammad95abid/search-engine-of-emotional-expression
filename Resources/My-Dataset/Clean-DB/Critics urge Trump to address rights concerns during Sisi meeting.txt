Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-SisixA0;is set to meet US President Donald Trump on Tuesday amid continued controversy at home over his bid to extend his rule andxA0;concerns over human rights violations.
The meeting will be Sisix2019;s second visit to the White House since he took office in 2014.
Relations between Cairo and Washington were tense under Trumpx2019;s predecessor, Barack Obama. But they have warmed considerably under Trump, who has been willing to set aside human rights concerns to rebuild close defence and diplomatic ties.
On Tuesday, the two heads of state will discuss military, economic, and counterterrorism cooperation, according to a White House statement.
x201C;The two leaders will also discuss developments and shared priorities in the region, including enhancing regional economic integration and addressing ongoing conflicts, and Egyptx2019;s longstanding role as a lynchpin of regional stability,x201D; a White House statement said.
Rights groups accuse Egypt of instituting a widespread crackdown on dissent, including the torture of political prisoners x2013; allegations the Egyptian government has denied.xA0;
Rights concerns are not expected to top Tuesdayx2019;s agenda, and groups accuse the US of overlooking abuses by Egypt.xA0;
InxA0;2018, the Trump administration released $195m in militaryxA0;aid to Egypt after withholding the assistance the previous year over human rights concerns. The US saidxA0;the decision followed steps Egypt took in response to specific US concerns, and it cited stronger US-Egypt ties in security and counterterrorism while also acknowledging remaining areas of concern about human rights and governance.
The Trump administration has asked Congress for $1.382bn in assistance for Egypt for the next fiscal year.
Earlier this year, MikexA0;Pompeo, the US secretary of state, delivered a speechat the American University in Cairo where he outlined Trumpx2019;s Middle East vision.xA0;

During his visit, Pompeo praised Sisi as a partner in the fight against x201C;terrorismx201D; while dodging questions over rising human rights concerns under Sisi.
Critics have urged the White House to address human rights concerns during Sisix2019;s visit to the US, as well as the Egyptian presidentx2019;s attempt to hold onto power.xA0;xA0;
x2018;Power grabx2019;
In February, Egyptx2019;s parliament approved a set of proposed constitutional amendments that would allow Sisi to rule up until 2034 and give the military greater power. The amendments are expected to be put to a referendum later this month.xA0;
x201C;The fact that the trip is happening right now is directly tied to Sisix2019;s desire for the US and Trumpx2019;s endorsement for his attempt to change the constitution to allow him to stay in power and bolster his power in other ways,x201D; said Amy Hawthorne, research director at the Project on Middle East Democracy Pomed.
Human Rights Watch HRW said on Tuesday that the amendments, which would also increase the militaryx2019;s political role and grant Sisi control over the judiciary, would x201C;institutionalise authoritarianismx201D;.xA0;
US officials have not publicly criticised efforts by the Egyptian parliament or Sisix2019;s supporters to advance amendments to the constitution, and some see Sisix2019;s White House visit as a way for the Egyptian president to secure the green light for the amendments.xA0;xA0;

x201C;Sisi is in Washington to obtain a green light for proposed constitutional amendments that grant the military highly abusive powers and further institutionalise authoritarianism,x201D; said Michael Page, HRWx2019;sxA0;deputy Middle East and Northern Africa director. 
x201C;Given President Trumpx2019;s silence on abuses, Congress should step up and condemn this initiative,x201D; he added.xA0;
Magdelina Mughrabi, the deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Amnesty International, added that the amendments would x201C;worsen the devastating human rights crisis Egyptians are already facingx201D;.xA0;
On Monday, a bipartisan group of leading US senators called on the State Department to raise key concerns in meetings with Sisi.
In a letter to Secretary of State Pompeo, 17 senators urged him to convey concerns over the detention of American citizens by the Egyptian government, Egyptx2019;s deepening relationship with the Kremlin including the reported purchase of Russian fighter jets, and the concerning erosion of political and worsening human rights in recent years.
