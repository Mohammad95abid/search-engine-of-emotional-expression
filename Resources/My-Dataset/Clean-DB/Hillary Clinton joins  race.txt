Bill Richardson, the governor for New Mexico who would be the first Hispanic president if he won the election, intends to announce his plans on Sunday.
x2018;Hope and optimismx2019;x201C;As a senator, I will spend two years doing everything in my power to limit the damage George W. Bush can do. But only a newxA0;president will be able to undo Bushx2019;s mistakes and restore our hopexA0;and optimism,x201D; Clinton said.

x201C;Letx2019;s talk. Letx2019;s chat. The conversation in Washington has been just a little one-sided lately, donx2019;t you think?x201D;

Clinton would be the first female president if she won the election, and with millions of dollars in the bank, a large network of supporters and strong backing in most polls, shexA0;is seen as having a good chance of capturing the White House. 
Following in Billx2019;s footsteps
She is also the first wife of a former president to pursue the office. Bill Clinton served two terms in the White House from 1993-2001.
Critics have said that Hillary Clinton lacks the natural charisma of her husband and is overly cautious when many voters say they want authenticity from a candidate.
But her allies counter by citing her strengths x2013; intelligence, depth of experience, work ethic and an immense command of policy detail.

Advisers argue those skills, plus her popularity among women and younger voters, position her strongly as both a primary and election candidate.
She won a landslide victory when she stood for the Senate for the first time in 2000, despite being criticised for standing in a state where she had never lived.
In the Senate, Clinton has quickly moved to establish herself as someone who can work with Republicans or Democrats, often sponsoring high-profile legislation with Republican colleagues.
Recently, she has toughened her criticism of the conduct of the war in Iraq and Bushx2019;s handling of the conflict but her vote for the use of force in 2002 remains a significant political hurdle with some voters.
