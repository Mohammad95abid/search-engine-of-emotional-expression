Egyptians did not see the walkout from parliament because television cameras had been banned.

The government argues that the amendments will enable the state of emergency, in place since the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat, the previous president, to be lifted.

xA0;
But Amnesty International has said the amendments x201C;write into the permanent law emergency-style powers that have been used to violate human rights over more than two decadesx201D;.

Rubber stamp
xA0;
On Tuesday, the Egyptian parliament is expected to rubber stamp Mubarakx2019;s proposed amendments before they are put to a popular referendum on April 4.
xA0;
The ruling National Democratic party NDP has a majority of seats in the Egyptian parliament large enough to pass the 34 amendments.
xA0;
But without the participation of most opposition parties, the NDP has been accused of lacking the moral authority to implement such changes.
xA0;
Egyptx2019;s opposition has already denounced the changes as x201C;opening the way to a police statex201D;.
xA0;
The Muslim Brotherhood, candidates of which constitute Egyptx2019;s main opposition, has said it will boycott the vote.
xA0;
Other opposition parties have said they will vote against the proposed amendments.
xA0;
Describing the reaction to the proposals, Amr El-Khaky, Al Jazeerax2019;s Cairo correspondent, said this was x201C;the first time in modern history that all opposition groups have come to an understandingx201D;.

Amendments criticised
xA0;
Critics of the government say the amendments are designed to pre-empt any further gains by the opposition and will pave the way for Gamal, Mubarakx2019;s son, to inherit power from his father.
xA0;
The proposed amendment to Article 179 has come in for particular criticism since it would allow the authorities to arrest suspects, search their homes, read their mail and tap their phones without a warrant.
xA0;
It would also mean civilians accused of x201C;terrorismx201D; could be tried in military courts.
xA0;
The change to Article 88, which governs elections, is also controversial because it repeals the judicial supervision of the ballot boxes.
xA0;
Many believe the judiciaryx2019;s supervision over the election process allowed for greater representation of opposition MPs in recent elections.
xA0;
But, in an interview published on Saturday with Akhbar Al-Youm, a government newspaper, Mubarak defended his amendments.
xA0;
He said the reforms were x201C;meant to deal with terrorism-related crimes only, through judiciary channels, and the judicial authorityx201D;.
xA0;
Mustafa al-Feki, a member of Egyptian parliament and chairman of the Egyptian Peoplex2019;s Assembly foreign affairs committee, said: x201C;Not all the opposition has left, but Ix2019;m not saying everything is rosy.
xA0;
x201C;I wish the Muslim Brotherhood had insisted to stay and expressed their ideas and views.
xA0;
x201C;Those who are already members of parliament have the right to say what they want, have it published and reject what they want to reject. Democracy is a kind of balance between different kinds of groups.x201D;
