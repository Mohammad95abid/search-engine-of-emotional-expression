Security forces in Egypt have clashed with hundreds of protesters in the port city of Suez, according to media reports, firing tear gas and live rounds to disperse crowds calling for PresidentxA0;Abdel Fattah el-SisixA0;to quit.
The unrest on Saturday came a day after thousands of people took to the streets in several Egyptian cities in a rare show of dissentagainst el-Sisi, who has overseen a broad crackdown on dissent including the jailing of thousands of dissidents and the effective banning of protests.

A protester in Suez told the AFP news agency about 200 people headed to the cityx2019;s central area for a second night in a row, where they were met by security forces and armoured vehicles.
x201C;They security force fired tear gas, rubber and live bullets and there were injuriesx201D;, the man who declined to be named told the AFP.xA0;
Another resident, who also preferred to remain anonymous, said the tear gas was so thick it had reached her apartment block a few kilometres away.
x201C;My nose started burning up. The smell was seeping through the balcony. I also saw some youth run and hide in our streetx201D;, the woman said.
Protests were also reported in Giza, the capital Cairox2019;s twin city, and in the northern town of Mahalla. Al Jazeera is banned from reporting inside Egypt.
Journalists warnedxA0;
Meanwhile, a heavy security presence was maintained in Cairox2019;s Tahrir Square, the epicentre of Egyptx2018;s 2011 revolution that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.
Egyptx2019;s stock exchange also suspended trading for 30 minutes on Sunday after the EGX 100 index fell by 5 percent.
Analysts linked the sharp drop in share prices to small protests that broke out in Cairo and other cities on Friday, reported Reuters.
It was the first time the exchange had suspended trading in the EGX 100 because of a 5 percent swing since 2016.
Separately,xA0;Egyptx2019;s State Information Service SIS, which accredits foreign media representatives, said it has x201C;carefully monitoredx201D; the coverage of the protest.
It called for reporters to x201C;strictly abide by professional codes of conductx201D; and for media to provide a space for x201C;viewpoints to be presented in an equal manner and that includes the viewpoint of the State or who represents itx201D;.
The SIS, which issued similar statements in the past surrounding sensitive events, also warned that x201C;social media outlets should not be considered as sources of newsx201D;, because of the numerous x201C;fake accounts and fabricationsx201D;.

Egyptians in US
Videos on social media showed dozens of Egyptians demonstrating in front of el-Sisix2019;s residence in New York, where he is scheduled to speak at the United Nations General Assembly this week.
The anti-Sisi demonstrations were met with tens of his supporters also staging a demonstration to chant slogans praising his achievements.
The Egyptian diaspora in Washington, DC also staged a vigil in front of the White House to denounce el-Sisi. The protesters called on US President Donald Trump to end his support for el-Sisi and demanded that el-Sisi leave the US.
The AFP, citing an unnamed security source, said at least 74 people had been arrested on Friday in the capital after clashes between police and protesters, who had marched through the streets of Cairo, chanting slogans including x201C;Leave, Sisi!x201D; and demanding the x201C;fall of the regimex201D;.
The Human Rights Watch rights group has calledxA0;for their immediate release. The Egyptian government is yet to comment.xA0;
The demonstrations were in response to an online call by an exiled Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Ali, who has accused el-Sisi and his aides of squandering public funds on vanity projects.
El-Sisi led the military removal of former PresidentxA0;Mohamed MorsixA0;in 2013 and won back-to-back landslide elections after running virtually unopposed. But his popularity has been dented amid discontent over rising prices.xA0;
El-Sisix2019;s government has imposed strict austerity measures in Egypt since 2016 as part of a $12bn loan package from the International Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, nearly one in three Egyptians live below the poverty line on less than $1.40 a day, according to official figures released in July. Other estimates put the figure higher.xA0;
Ali, a construction contractor, upped the pressure on Saturday in an expletive-filled video, imploring Egyptians to join a x201C;million-man marchx201D; next Friday and to fill all x201C;major squaresx201D; of the country.
x201C;This is a peoplex2019;s revolution x2026; We have to link up together as one x2026; and organise going down to the major squares,x201D; he said in a Facebook appeal to his followers.
El-Sisi denied the corruption allegations last week, telling a youth conference he was x201C;honest and faithfulx201D; to his people and the military.
Mohamad Elmasry, chair of the media and journalism programme at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that the popularity of Alix2019;s videos and the protests they sparked posed a x201C;legitimate threatx201D; to el-Sisi.
x201C;Millions of people have watched his videos, while his anti-Sisi hashtags have gone viral,x201D; Elmasry told Al Jazeera.xA0;x201C;This is something that is a legitimate threat to the el-Sisi government x2013; if it wasnx2019;t a legitimate threat, then el-Sisi wouldnx2019;t have come out and responded directly to Mohamed Ali at last weekx2019;s youth conference,x201D; said Elmasry, adding it was x201C;unprecedentedx201D; for el-Sisi x201C;to be put on the defensive like that inside Egypt by an Egyptianx201D;.
Nael Shama, a Cairo-based political analyst, agreed.

 x201C;No one shouted bread, freedom, social justice like in 2011, they escalated straight to x2018;Leavex2019; from the first minute,x201D; she told AFP news agency, adding: x201C;This is the first time people take to the streets in many years but I am not sure it will be the last.x201D;
Meanwhile, the governmentx2019;s foreign media accreditation body released a statement late on Saturday cautioning international journalists that their reporting of events x201C;should not be exaggeratedx201D;, without explicitly mentioning the protests.
On Friday night, pro-Sisi television host Amr Adib lambasted Ali, the businessman, showing footage of him allegedly in a drunken stupor.
Adib urged his fellow countrymen to x201C;take care of the country x2026; because the Muslim Brotherhood want to raze it to the groundx201D;.
The Islamist group, once considered one of Egyptx2019;s most organised political forces, was outlawed as a x201C;terrorx201D; group in 2013 after the militaryx2019;s overthrow of Morsi.
