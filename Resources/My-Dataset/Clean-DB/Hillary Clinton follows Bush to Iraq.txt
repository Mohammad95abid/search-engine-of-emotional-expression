Clinton was spending one day in the insurgency-ridden Iraqi capital, during which she met top US civilian and military officials including US overseer Paul Bremer and ground forces commander Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez.xA0;
She also lunched with troops from her home state of New York in the dining hall at the former city centre palace of oustedxA0;leader Saddam Hussein, which is now the seat of the US-led occupation administration.xA0;
Unlike the US president, who never left the main military camp at Baghdad airport during his two-and-a-half hour stopover, Clinton then left the heavily fortified complex around the palace to go and visit troops.xA0;
Hearts and minds
She also met Iraqi officials, including the sole woman member of the US-installed interim cabinet, public works minister Nasrin Mustafa Sadiq Barwari.xA0;

Clinton warned that thexA0;US-led occupation still faced many enemies in Iraq and urged the US administration to change its reconstruction strategy to allow the United Nations a greater role in postwar Iraq.xA0;
x201C;It is no longer sufficient for our military to win battles but they have to win the hearts and minds. It is a very big challenge,x201D; said Clinton, who visited Baghdad as part of a tour of conflict zones that saw her spend Thanksgiving with US troops in Afghanistan.xA0;
x201C;We arexA0;in a very difficult political situation, trying to expedite a process for self-governance that will be very challenging,x201D; Clinton said. x201C;We have a lot of adversaries that wish us and the Iraqi people nothing but bad news.x201D;
UN role
Clinton said it was still not too late to give the United Nations a leading role in administering Iraq to relieve expense and pressure from the US-led occupiers, but was pessimistic this would take place.xA0;

x201C;We face a very big hill to climb. We face a complex security situation. The process of putting together self-governance in a short period of time is very difficult. We still need more help, more support from the international community.x201D;xA0;
x201C;I am a big believer that we ought to internationalise this, but it will take a big change in our administrationx2019;s thinking,x201D; Clinton said. x201C;I donx2019;t see that it isxA0;forthcoming.x201D;xA0;
The former first lady, who is now a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she had x201C;wanted to come to Iraq to let the troops know about the great job they are doing.x201D;
