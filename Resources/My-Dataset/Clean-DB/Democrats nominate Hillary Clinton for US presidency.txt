The Democratic Party has made history by nominating Hillary Clinton to run for US president as the first woman to head a major partyx2019;s presidential ticket.
Speaking via videolink from New York after her nomination on Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton told the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia that she was honoured to have been chosen as the partyx2019;s nominee.
x201C;I am so happy. Itx2019;s been a great day and night. What an incredible honour that you have given me. And I canx2019;t believe that wex2019;ve just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet. Thanks to you and everyone who has fought so hard to make this possible,x201D; she said.
x201C;And if there are any little girls out there, who have stayed up late to watch, let me just say: I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.x201D;

We just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet.x201D; x2014;Hillary https://t.co/mYkaLIv861

Delegates erupted in cheers throughout the roll call of states on the floor of the convention earlier in the evening.xA0;
x201C;Shex2019;s got it. She has the numbers that are needed,x201D; Al Jazeerax2019;s James Bays said from the convention when Clinton passed the 2,383 votes needed to secure the nomination.
x201C;We knew this was going to happen because obviously we knew she was the presumptive nominee and that she had all the votes that she needed from the primaries. But what happened here was a roll call, state by state announcing their votes. How many for Bernie Sanders. How many for Hillary Clinton. And a great deal of drama in the room.x201D;
x2018;The best darn change makerx2019;
In nominating Clinton, delegate after delegate at the convention made the point that the selection of a woman was a milestone in Americax2019;s 240-year-old history. US women got the right to vote in 1920.
Clinton promises to tackle income inequality and rein in Wall Street if she becomes president, and is eager to portray Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality TV show host, as too unstable to sit in the Oval Office.
Trump, who has never held elective office, got a boost in opinion polls from his nomination at the Republican convention last week and had a 2-point lead over Clinton in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.
After the roll call of states formalising Clintonx2019;s nomination, Bill Clinton, the former US president, took the stage for a history-making appearance of his own convention.
Former presidents often vouch for their potential successors, but never before has that candidate also been a spouse.
 Telling the story of their life together, Bill Clinton summed up his wife: x201C;Shex2019;s the best darn change maker Ix2019;ve ever met.x201D; 

So proud of you, Hillary. DemsInPhilly

He also gave a spirited defence of his wifex2019;s tenure as secretary of state, telling the convention that Hillary Clinton was instrumental in protecting American interests, combating terrorism and advancing human rights.
She put x201C;climate change at the centre of our foreign policyx201D; and x201C;backed President Barack Obamax2019;s decision to go after Osama bin Laden,x201D; the former president said.
Bill Schneider, a US political analyst, told Al Jazeera: x201C;There was a clear message in Bill Clintonx2019;s speech x2013; one word: change. A very important word because voters donx2019;t believe she is the candidate of change. They think she is the candidate of the status quo.x201D;
Healing deep divisions
Clintonx2019;s campaign now hopes to move past the dissent that marked the conventionx2019;s opening day on Monday, when supporters of Bernie Sanders, Clintonx2019;s primary rival, repeatedly interrupted proceedings with boos and chants of x201C;Berniex201D;.
























US election: Sanders urges support for Clinton at DNC





SandersxA0;took the DNC podium on Monday to urge his supporters to come together and vote for Clinton.
Delegates erupted in cheers as Sanders helped to make Clintonx2019;s Tuesday night victory official when the roll call got to his home state of Vermont x2013; an important show of unity for a party trying to heal deep divisions.
x201C;I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States,x201D; Sanders declared, asking that it be by acclamation.
Sandersx2019; endorsement was a striking parallel to the role Clinton played eight years ago when she stepped to the microphone on the convention floor in support of her former rival, Barack Obama.
Not all Sanders supporters were as conciliatory.
A large group signalled their displeasure with Clintonx2019;s nomination by walking off the convention floor and holding a demonstration at the nearby media workspace, Al Jazeerax2019;s Kimberly Halkett said.
Holding a sit-in inside the media tent, several Sanders supporters had their mouths taped shut to symbolise their lack of voice at the convention.

x201C;Essentially what they are trying to say is that the media is responsible for squashing their voice throughout this nominating contest,x201D; Halkett said.
x201C;In some way influencing the results, and as a result what they are calling this protest is x2018;no voice, no unityx2019;. They feel this process, this nominating contest, was not democratic.x201D;
























Bernie supporters take to Philadelphia streets ahead of DNC






Rashane Handy, 25, a single mother from Kansas who took part in the protest, said she felt that the party had pressured Sanders supporters to support Clinton by holding up the spectre of a victory for Donald Trump if they donx2019;t get behind Hillary.
 x201C;Ix2019;m tired of being misrepresented. We need progressives on the ballot. Our healthcare is suffering and our education is suffering. Sanders didnx2019;t just bring out political people; he brought out people like me, single mothers, black people, Latinos. If we vote for Hillary, wex2019;d be voting for the lesser of two evils,x201D; Handy told Al Jazeera. 
Earlier in the night, it looked like the dispute between the Sanders and Clinton supporters had turned a corner.
x201C;In many ways, the person who managed to unite the party was the one who started his movement and then had to actually calm down the people that he ignited, and that was Bernie Sanders,x201D; Al Jazeerax2019;s James Bays said.
x201C;I think Bernie Sanders and the speech of Michelle Obama, the first lady, brought a degree of unity that certainly wasnx2019;t here at the beginning of day one. Yes, there are still people who feel hurt by whatx2019;s happened. There are still people who are going to continue not supporting Hillary Clinton, but I think they look like theyx2019;ve won over the majority.x201D;

Speaking at the conventionx2019;s opening on Monday, the first lady announced her support for Clinton. She also offered a thinly veiled jab at Trump while discussing how her family has had to adapt to the shrill tone of todayx2019;s politics.
x201C;We insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country,x201D; Obama said.
