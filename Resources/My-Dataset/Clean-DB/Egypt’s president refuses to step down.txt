Cairo x2013;xA0;Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi has rejected calls for his resignation, saying that he is Egyptx2019;s x201C;guardian of legitimacyx201D; after three days of nationwide pro- and anti-government demonstrations, that have drawn millions to the streets.
His speech was a response to the protests, and to an ultimatum from Egyptx2019;s military, which on Tuesday said it would issue a political x201C;road mapx201D; unless Morsi resolved the crisis in 48 hours. Morsi had earlier dismissed the ultimatum, demanding in a message posted on Twitter that the army rescind it.

In his televised speech on Tuesday night, Morsi accused members of former president Hosni Mubarakx2019;s regime of trying to topple his government and undermine the revolution.
x201C;There is no substitute for legitimacy,x201D; Morsi said in the 45-minute late-night address. x201C;The revolution of January 25 will achieve its goals. Legitimacy will be safeguarded, and I am willing to give my own life to protect it.x201D;
Just hours after his speech, the health ministry reported that unidentified gunman had killed 18 people and wounded at least 200 more after opening fire on a rally of his supporters in the capital.
At least seven other people were killed and dozens more injured in clashes in Cairo between the presidentx2019;s supporters and opponents.
Morsix2019;s speech was received with a mix of anger and disbelief among the vast crowd of protesters gathered outside the presidential palace.
His remarks were punctuated several times by loud chants of x201C;irhal!x201D; x2013; x201C;leave!x201D;
x201C;Legitimacy? Itx2019;s like he was trying to convince himself,x201D; said demonstratorxA0;Nader Amer.
The president invoked the idea of legitimacy dozens of times in his speech, saying that he was obligated as Egyptx2019;s first democratically-elected president to remain in office.
x201C;What legitimacy? Look around, look at the millions in Cairo and the governorates,x201D; he said, referring to the anti-government protesters gathered nationwide.
The presidentx2019;s speech was greeted with cheers in Cairox2019;s Nasr City neighbourhood, however, where thousands of his supporters have been staging a sit-in since Friday.
x2018;Back to dictatorshipx2019;
The army has not specified what it will do once itx2019;s 48 hour ultimatum issued on Monday expires.
Details of the armyx2019;s proposed x201C;road mapx201D; were leaked to the Reuters news agency on Tuesday. It would reportedly dismiss what remains of the parliament x2013; the lower house was dissolved by court order last year x2013; and suspend the constitution pending new elections.
Morsi met on Tuesday with General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the defence minister and army chief. The presidency has said it had no knowledge of the armyx2019;s ultimatum before it was issued.

HexA0;urged his supporters to remain non-violent, and rejected calls for x201C;jihadx201D; holy war by some of his supporters, saying that it should only be conducted against x201C;enemies outside the statex201D;.
He added, however, that he was willing to x201C;sacrifice my blood for the sake of stability and security of this homelandx201D;.
Khaled Daoud, a spokesman for the National Salvation Front, the largest formal opposition bloc in Egypt, called that a x201C;clear incitement for civil warx201D;.
Morsi offered no concrete concessions in his speech. He mentioned proposals to dismiss the cabinet and install a technocratic government, and to create a committee to amend the constitution, which was approved by a public referendum last year. But he said the opposition had already rejected those demands, and beyond that only offered more x201C;national dialoguex201D;, which his opponents have already rejected.
His offer will not assuage public anger, not with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets for a third night to demand his resignation.
Morsi continues to lose support from within his government as well. Foreign Minister Kamel Amr tended his resignation, becoming the sixth minister to quit within the past 48 hours. Two of Morsix2019;s presidential spokesmen also quit.
On Monday Sami Enan, his military adviser, resigned and said the army would not x201C;abandon the will of the peoplex201D;.
x201C;The Muslim Brotherhood has only their supporters, and theyx2019;re staying behind him, but outside the core hex2019;s weakened,x201D; said Khaled Fahmy, an Egyptian historian and activist. x201C;People are abandoning ship.x201D;
