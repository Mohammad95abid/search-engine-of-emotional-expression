Democrats moved on Tuesday to nominate former Vice President Joe Biden as their presidential candidate to take on United States President Donald Trump in the November 3 election. Tonight gives Biden his first opportunity to address the nation as a presidential candidate in a formal speech.


The speech was a test for Biden, who is well known for his straight-talk gaffes. However, some have noted that Bidenx2019;s speaking abilities have faltered in recent years, with some critics raising questions about his mental acuity. Trump has already started calling the former vice president x201C;Sleepy Joex201D;.


Bidenx2019;s big night came as the US economy continues to struggle, with unemployment rising amid the coronavirus pandemic. Observers have noted that the convention thus far has been lofty in its criticisms of Trump and hopeful rhetoric, but relatively light on policy proposals. Biden delivered concrete proposals with personal stories.


A range of other Democratic party figures spoke on the final night of the Democratic National Convention DNC, with former presidential candidates Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and billionaire media mogul Mike Bloomberg featured prominently.

These were the updates:

Biden called the situation in the US a x201C;perfect storm: the worst pandemic in over 100 yearsx201D; and x201C;the worst economic crisis since the Great Depressionx201D;. He said the country was experiencing x201C;the biggest call for racial justice since the 60sx201D;, referencing the major crisis of the US, saying itx2019;s a x201C;time of real peril, but extraordinary possibilitiesx201D;.
Biden cited the over five million and 170,000 dead as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, along with its serious economic toll, promising to get the virus x201C;under controlx201D; as his first step as president.

Biden spoke fondly of former President Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president, and his landmark x201C;Obamacarex201D; law, which Republicans have vowed to repeal, promising to expand healthcare access.
Speaking about the economy, Biden said that if Trump wins, x201C;working families will struggle to get by x2026; and yet the wealthiest one percentx201D; will continue to gain billions x2013; echoing common rhetoric from progressive leader Senator Bernie Sanders and coming alongside a promise to change a tax code that x201C;rewards wealth more than it rewards workx201D;.

Women will receive equal pay for equal work, he said, and early childhood care will be available to all. Social Security and Medicare, popular sections of the US welfare system aimed at the elderly, will be protected.
Biden also referenced George Floydx2019;s death, saying the US might be ready to end the x201C;scourgex201D; of racism.
02:20 GMT x2013; Former Democratic presidential candidates remember Biden as leader, force for good
A group of former Democratic presidential hopefuls sat in a virtual roundtable to discuss their memories of Biden as a leader.
Buttigieg opened the segment with a standalone speech, saying x201C;over 10 years ago, I joined a military where firing me because of who I am wasnx2019;t just possible x2013; it was policyx201D;, referring to the former policy of x201C;Donx2019;t Ask, Donx2019;t Tellx201D;, the US militaryx2019;s stance on not allowing openly LGBT members.
x201C;Now in 2020, it is unlawful in America to fire anyone because of who they are or who they love. The very ring on my finger reflects how this country can change.x201D;

Sanders said Biden x201C;is decentx201D;, which the US needs especially now. x201C;Whether youx2019;re progressives x2026; moderates x2026; or conservatives, we must come together,x201D; he urged.
Booker concluded the segment by telling the others, x201C;It was an honour to run against you. It is a greater honour to stand with you,x201D; referencing their group effort to get Biden elected.
02:02 GMT x2013; Cory Booker recalls familyx2019;s history as workers in case for Biden
Senator Booker, a former presidential candidate, recalled his grandfatherx2019;s history in moving from the segregated US South to Detroit, where he made a living by working blue-collar jobs.
The working class is pivotal for Biden, Harris and the Democratic party, Booker said, and they will be appreciated if Biden is elected.

x201C;Wex2019;ll stand for those who cook, and serve, and clean; who plant and harvest; who pack and always deliver, whose hands are thick with calluses, like my grandadx2019;s who held mine when I was a boy,x201D; Booker said.
x201C;If he was alive, Joe and Kamala, he would be so proud of you x2013; and hex2019;d tell us, take another by the hand, and another, and letx2019;s get to work, this dream ainx2019;t free, you gotta work for it.x201D;

The virtual Democratic National Convention attracted its biggest TV audience to date on Wednesday when former President Barack Obama and vice-presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris made their appeals to voters, according to data from tracking firm Nielsen.

The TV audience for the convention, where Democrats nominated Joe Biden for president, remained below the level of 2016. TV viewership was about seven percent higher on night three of the convention four years ago.
But the TV figures do not include viewing on digital platforms, which has jumped significantly since 2016 as traditional television watching has declined.

23:42 GMT x2013; AOC calls out Democrats for challenging progressives in primaries
New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a figurehead of the burgeoning progressive movement within the Democratic Party, tweeted a challenge to Democrats after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would endorse a moderate challenger to the progressive MassachusettsxA0;Senator Ed Markey.
Pelosi will endorse Joe Kennedy, a relative of former President John F Kennedy, to challenge Markey.
Progressive challengers have made gains in the wake of Senator Bernie Sandersx2019;s two presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020. Often, they have done so by challenging unpopular, moderate Democrats in safe seats.
These challenges have gone without support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee DCCC, which works to elect Democrats to Congress andxA0;usually blacklists its associates from working to unseat Democrats in good standing.
x201C;Sox201D;, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted to the DCCC, x201C;when can we expect you to reverse your blacklist policy against primary orgs?x201D;

No one gets to complain about primary challenges again. x1F917;
So dccc, when can we expect you to reverse your blacklist policy against primary orgs?
Because between this amp; lack of care around IlhanMNx2019;s challenger, it seems like less a policy and more a cherry-picking activity. https://t.co/xSneSK8H2q

The challenge comes amid talks of a feud between the progressive wing x2013; which observers say has been noticeably absent from the DNC x2013; and the moderate wing, headed by Biden.
23:24 GMT x2013; Pelosi says the election depends on Wisconsin
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Attorney General Eric Holder delivered a stark reminder to Wisconsin Democrats on Thursday about the importance the Midwestern battleground state plays in the presidential election less than 11 weeks away.
Wisconsin did not get the national attention it hoped for when the Democratic convention x2013; originally planned for the statex2019;s biggest city, Milwaukee x2013; was moved online due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.
The Democratsx2019; previous nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, did not visit the state during the 2016 campaign, though Trump visited several times. Trumpx2019;s victory by razor-thin margins there helped in the US Electoral College, which guaranteed him the presidency in spite of losing the popular vote.
After Trumpx2019;s narrow victory of fewer than 23,000 votes in the state in 2016 x2013; and with polls showing another close race this year x2013; Democrats are pledging not to downplay the importance of Wisconsin in Bidenx2019;s efforts to defeat Trump.

Former White House adviser Steve Bannon, an architect of Trumpx2019;s 2016 election victory, was arrested on a yacht and pleaded not guilty on Thursday after being charged with defrauding donors in a scheme to help build the presidentx2019;s signature wall along the US-Mexico border.
The indictment claims the x201C;schemex201D; was related to an online crowdfunding campaign that claims to have raised more than $25m to build a wall along the southern border of the US, a signature policy proposal from Trump.

As a top adviser to Trumpx2019;s 2016 presidential campaign who later served as White House chief strategist, Bannon helped articulate the right-wing populism and fierce opposition to immigration that have helped define Trumpx2019;s three and a half years in office.
21:45 GMT x2013; Unemployment ticks up as coronavirus continues in the US
The number of workers in the US who are filing for state unemployment benefits climbed back above one million last week, signalling that businesses continue to lay off workers as the economy struggles to climb out of the deep recessionary hole caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Some 1.1 million Americans filed initial jobless claims with states in the week ending August 15, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday. That is 135,000 more than the previous week, when the number fell below one million for the first time since March.

For the millions of Americans collecting unemployment, times are only getting tougher. The $600 federal weekly top-up to state benefits expired last month. Trump issued an executive order for a replacement $300-a-week federal top-up bankrolled by the governmentx2019;s disaster relief fund, but only half of states so far have said that they will be applying for that additional aid.
The state of the economy was always a strength for Trump, but it is turning into a liability. Read more here.
