EgyptxA0;will hold a three-day referendum starting on Saturday over proposed constitutional changes that could allow PresidentxA0;Abdel FattahxA0;el-SisixA0;to stay in power until 2030.
The ballot will run between April 20-22 and will also see voters decide on whether an upper parliamentary chamber should be created, Lasheen Ibrahim, the chairman of the National Election Authority, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The announcement came a day after Egyptx2019;s parliament passed the proposed amendments, signing off on potentially extending Sisix2019;s tenure until 2030 by permitting thexA0;general-turned-president to extend his current mandate by two years until 2024, and then stand for another six-year term.
The 596-member assembly is packed with el-Sisi supporters, with 531 of the 554 legislators who attended the vote opting in favour of the constitutional changes.
But critics have decried the proposals as another step back to authoritarianism, eight years after a pro-democracy uprising put an end toxA0;Hosni Mubarakx2018;s three-decade rule.

Sisix2019;s government has been repeatedly criticised by human rights organisations for alleged repression of political opponents.
In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty InternationalxA0;saidxA0;the proposed constitutional amendments would x201C;facilitate the authoritiesx2019; crackdown on freedom of expression, association and assembly, erode peoplex2019;s rights, and exacerbate the human rights crisis in the countryx201D;.
x201C;The decision to put these amendments to the constitution to a public referendum, amid the worst crackdown on freedom of expression and severe restrictions on political parties and independent media, demonstrates the Egyptian governmentx2019;s contempt for the rights of all people in Egypt,x201D;xA0;said Magdalena Mughrabi, Amnestyx2019;s deputy Middle East and North Africa director.
Sisi himself won power in a 2014 ballot after leading a military coup the year before to depose hisxA0;democratically electedxA0;predecessor, PresidentxA0;Mohamed Morsi, of the now-outlawedxA0;Muslim BrotherhoodxA0;movement.xA0;
The 64-year-old was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote,xA0;in a ballot boycotted by large swaths of the countryx2019;s political opposition after several potential candidates dropped out citing intimidation or were arrested.
Only one other candidate, himself an ardent Sisi supporter, opposed the incumbent.xA0;Mousa Mostafa MousaxA0;had endorsed Sisi for a second term and even organised events to help nominate the former military commander up until a week before the nomination deadline.
The election commission said last yearx2019;s vote was held according to the x201C;highest international standards of integrity and transparencyx201D;, but rights groups including international NGO Human Rights Watch slammed the ballot as neither x201C;free nor fairx201D;.
