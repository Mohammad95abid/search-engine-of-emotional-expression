Joe Biden and Barack Obama are stepping up their attacks on United States President Donald Trump and defending their own time in the White House in a new video depicting their first in-person meeting sincexA0;the coronavirus outbreakxA0;began.
Snippets offered by Bidenx2019;s campaign showed the pair wearing masks while arriving at an office, then sitting down at a distance from each other to observexA0;social distancingxA0;for a bare-faced chat.
The full video will be posted on social media on Thursday, but teasers showed Biden and Obama discussing passing their administrationx2019;s signature healthcare law and blaming Trump for stoking division and animosity among Americans from the moment he entered the 2016 presidential race.
They were sharply critical ofxA0;the Republican presidentx2019;s efforts to combat a virus that hasxA0;killed more than 143,000 people in the US.
x201C;Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying, x2018;Itx2019;s not my responsibility, I take no responsibilityx2019;?x201D;xA0;Biden says, offering a line of attack similar to his recent campaign speeches when he asserted that Trump x201C;quitx201D; on the country and has x201C;waved the white flagx201D; amid the pandemic.
x201C;Those words didnx2019;t come out of our mouths while we were in office,x201D; Obama replies.
The former president largely stayed out ofxA0;the once-crowded Democratic primaryxA0;butxA0;endorsed Biden in April, when he was the last candidate standing. Obama hosted a virtual fundraiser for his former vice president last month thatxA0;raised $7.6m, the most of any Biden campaign event so far. He warned then against Democrats becoming x201C;complacent and smugx201D;.

The meeting in the video x2013; and the Biden campaign promoting it to voters x2013; illustratesxA0;the larger role Obama is expected to play forxA0;the presumptive Democratic presidential nomineexA0;in the months before November.
InxA0;another excerpt, Biden refers to Trump launching his 2016 campaign at Trump Tower, saying: x201C;He ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator, and I think people are now going, x2018;I donx2019;t want my kid growing up that way.apos;x201D;
Obama responds that he had confidence in Bidenx2019;s x201C;heart and your character, and the fact that you are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people togetherx201D;.
Another scenexA0;features Biden discussing the final months beforexA0;his son Beau died of brain cancerxA0;and recalling thinking x201C;to myself, what would happen if his insurance company was able to come in x2013; which they could have done before we passed Obamacare x2013; and said, x2018;You have outrun your insurance.apos;x201D;
Obama says: x201C;I couldnx2019;t be prouder of what we got done.x201D;
x201C;Twenty million people have health insurance that didnx2019;t have it because of what we did,x201D; the former president adds.
