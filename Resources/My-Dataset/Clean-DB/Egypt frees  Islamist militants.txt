Jamaa Islamiya merged in the late 1970s with another Islamist group, Al-Jihad. They are held responsible for planning and carrying out the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981.

Jamaa was also responsible for a wave of violence across Egypt in the 1990s, notably a November 1997 attack at Luxor that killed 58 people, most of them foreign tourists.
