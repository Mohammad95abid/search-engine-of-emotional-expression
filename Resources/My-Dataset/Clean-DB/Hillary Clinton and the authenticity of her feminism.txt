x201C;You can be completely x2026; unenthusiastic about Hillary Clinton and still be a feministx201D; tweeted Vice contributing editor Sarah Jeong. The blunt sentiment came on the heels of Clintonx2019;s strong performance in the first Democratic primary debate, striking a particularly disheartening note for a candidate who is losing ground with the one constituency that ought to be her own.
A CNN-ORC poll shows Clinton as experiencing a nationwide slide among female voters from 75 percent in DecemberxA0;2014, down to 51 percent in August 2015.
Eight years after her first presidential bid, her campaign narrative is taking a familiar turn: Hillary Clinton now has a x201C;womanx201D; problem. The headlines are eerily similar, as are the reasons offered for the disillusionment.

Feminists are still unhappy as ever with her voting record. Clintonx2019;s controversial vote to authorise the Iraq war was held against her in 2008. Today, itx2019;s her late and grudging support for gay marriage. More damaging, however, are the continuing issues with her character.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in August found that just 34 percent of white women have a positive view of her, and 58 percent of women in a Fox News poll say that Clinton x201C;knowingly liedx201D; with regards to the ongoing email controversy surrounding her time as secretary of state. Women donx2019;t seem to trust Hillary.
Feminist expression
Authenticity has remained the great albatross of Clintonx2019;s political career. In her book, titled x201C;Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politicsx201D;, Shawn Parry-Giles argues that that the mainstream mediax2019;s judgement of her character is based on a gender double-bind: The press first positioned the x201C;real Hillaryx201D; as a polarising feminist with x201C;likabilityx201D; issues, and then used that very image to question her authenticity over and again.

The apos;real Hillaryapos; was and remains a white, middle-class feminist, and of a generation that was taught too well that glass ceilings could be broken - but only by mastering the rules written and administered by men, and by pushing, but only so fast and so far.
 


The result is an extended media narrative driven forward by a series of x201C;makeoversx201D;, real or perceived, each of which has served to confirm the unreliability of Clintonx2019;s public persona.
The woman who told CBSx2019; 60 Minutes back in 1992, x201C;You know, I am not sitting here, some little woman standing by her manx201D; would spend great many years as thexA0;first lady doing just that x2013; and being pilloried for it.
Decades later, Billx2019;s duplicity has become damning evidence of Hillaryx2019;s unreliability, with Republican leader Lindsey Graham sniping, x201C;I am fluent in Clinton-speak. When Bill says he didnx2019;t have sex with that woman, he did x2026; When she tells us: x2018;Trust me, youx2019;ve got all the emails you need,x2019; we havenx2019;t even scratched the surface.x201D;
The greater irony is that the woman who was deemed too x201C;liberatedx201D; back in 1992 has, as a presidential candidate, been deemed x201C;not feminist enoughx201D;, as Slatex2019;s Meghan Ox2019;Rourke put it in her post-mortem of the 2008 bid.
Harsh words that Clinton seems to have taken fully to heart given her roaring, unambiguous embrace of the F-word in 2015. But this full-throated tom-tomming of her gender has played as yet another strategic course correction.
So when Clinton unequivocally told Girlsx2019; star Lena Dunham, x201C;Ix2019;m a feminist, and I say it whenever Ix2019;m askedx201D;, it was dismissed by women pundits like Daily Beastx2019;s Lizzie Crocker as x201C;political pandering at its most transparentx201D;.
Hitting the glass ceiling
Parry-Giles and other Hillary sympathisers are entirely right when they argue that the demand for authenticityxA0;places a disproportionate and unfair burden on minority candidates aspiring for the highest office.























Head to Head x2013; War on women, war on liberty?





The bar is far lower for white men like, say, George W Bush who can leverage the most synthetic form of authenticity x2013; be it cutting brush at a Texas ranch or swaggering in a flight suit x2013; to sell themselves as the x201C;real thingx201D;. But the greater and more intractable dilemma may well be that a 67-year-old Hillary Clintonx2019;s politics are, in fact, authentic.
The x201C;real Hillaryx201D; was and remains a white, middle-class feminist, and of a generation that was taught too well that glass ceilings could be broken x2013; but only by mastering the rules written and administered by men, and by pushing, but only so fast and so far.
Cast in this light, a political history of political realignments can instead be seen as the efforts of a ferociously ambitious woman of her time to get ahead by doing what was required of her, whether it was settling for a political partnership instead of a career, or running as a tough centrist to earn her Senate seat, and again in a bid for the presidency.
Now, it is unlikely that the 61-year-old Carly Fiorina reached the top echelons of corporate America without making considerable concessions of her own x2013; except that these were not played out in the white-hot glare of media scrutiny.



It is also unlikely that an older Barack Obama with a longer political career would not have made the many compromises that were required of black politicians before him x2013; or been quite as hex2019;s been able to be so as to write his own story, and therefore author his authenticity.
The fact is that Hillaryx2019;s problem of authenticity is as much generational as it is personal. Herex2019;s a woman who diligently learned to colour inside the lines, only to find that the lines themselves have shifted.
This, then, is the tragedy of Hillary: Just as she has finally reached a point where she can own her feminism, it has been deemed outdated and inauthentic by the very same women whom she aspired to represent.
