Cairo, Egypt x2013;xA0;One day after Cairo police cleared two sit-ins held in support of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, the capital city was slow to wake.
Hours after the state-of-emergency curfew was lifted, traffic and signs of life began to appear by late morning on Thursday.
But in some quarters, life was not going back to normal after at least 525 people were killed in the clearings in Cairo and ensuing clashes here and across the country.
In Giza, hundreds of Morsi supporters set fire to the local government offices, prompting the government to authorise the use of live ammunition on anyone attacking state buildings.
And in the al-Iman mosque in Nasr City, the neighbourhood where a massive, 47-day vigil was held at the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque, hundreds of bodies from Wednesdayx2019;s violence still lined floors of the makeshift morgue.
Wrapped in shrouds and kept cool with blocks of ice, most of the bodies bore gunshot wounds, but a number were charred, making them hard to identify for family members.
x2018;No weaponsx2019;
Samr Badredeen was at al-Iman mosque on Thursday, simply to grieve.
x201C;They killed my husband and then they burned his body. I canx2019;t find him,x201D; she wept.
x201C;He had no weapons on him x2026; If he had a weapon, he would have been able to defend himself,x201D; she said of her husband, Aymen Mohamed Zakayadeen, a 45-year-old electrical engineer and the father of four, aged 5 to 12.
x201C;In his last phone call at 9am he told me he was fine x2026; At 3pm, his friend called to tell me he was martyred.x201D;
Many of those at the sit-in wrote their names on their hands at the time of the attack so that their bodies could be identified. Now their names were listed on cardboard signs at the end of each row, where they lay waiting to be buried.
x2018;Excellentx2019; job
Strategic security expert Mokhtar Qandil told Al Jazeera that Wednesdayx2019;s operation was x201C;a very important strategy to cut the cancer called the Muslim Brotherhood from Egyptx2019;s bodyx201D;.
x201C;It was done very legally and very quietly,x201D; said Qandil of the day-long clearingxA0;of the sit-ins in Rabaa and Giza.
x201C;The police kept telling them to leave, please leave, you are safe, you are free, but they stayed, why? For Morsi? Morsi failed,x201D; Qandil said.
x201C;What can the police do with these people?x201D;
Qandil said the police did an x201C;an excellent job with the least loss of life. They succeeded.x201D;
x201C;It was a good plan for finishing the protests x2013; it was not unusual and it was not illegal.x201D;
He echoed remarks by interim Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi, who in an address on Egyptian television defended the clearing as necessary to x201C;restore the security of Egyptiansx201D; and praised the Ministry of Interior and police for showing restraint x201C;to the maximum levelx201D;.
However, even rights groups that have accused Morsix2019;s supporters, largely organised by the Muslim Brotherhood, of inciting violence hold police responsible for what they called a x201C;tragedyx201D;.
x201C;We believe the security apparatus could have avoided this human tragedy if it had complied with international rules and standards for the dispersal of assembliesx201D; read axA0;joint statement signed by nine rights organisations in Egypt.
The statement also criticised security authorities for failing to secure the areas around the Giza and Rabaa sit-ins earlier, allowing x201C;weapons, ammunition, and fortifications to enter the sit-ins and led to killing, torture, and physical assaults on journalists with impunityx201D;.
Mohamed Zaree, Egypt programme manager for the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, one of the signatories of the statement, marvelled at a statement by the Ministry of Interior which saidxA0;that a death toll of between 3,000 and 5,000 would be likely, characterising the number of deaths as x201C;awkwardx201D; and likely to have economic blowback rather than being an unacceptable loss of life.
x201C;I donx2019;t think that there is any loss that is acceptable x2013; this has nothing to do with international standards,x201D; said Zaree, adding that he would like to know how such a number of acceptable losses was calculated.
x2018;Reasonablex2019; to whom?
For Egyptians who felt the sit-ins were either a nuisance, misguided or a threat to national security, the deaths resulting from Wednesdayx2019;s operations appeared to bexA0;an acceptable price to pay.

Twitter has been buzzing with defenders of Cairo police, many of whom referred to the Muslim Brotherhood as x201C;terroristsx201D; and x201C;murderersx201D;.
As plumes of smoke rose from the surrounded sit-in on Wednesday and gunshots were heard echoing out of Rabaa Square, crowds gathered near the police lines to chant slogans praising Egyptian army chief General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Cairo police.
Local newspapers had reported that estimates of up to 10 percent loss of life was expected, something security experts previouslyxA0;toldxA0;xA0;Al Jazeera was x201C;reasonable losses that people will accept to overcome the political crisesx201D;.
The notion of what is a reasonable loss is hard to quantify in a place like al-Iman mosque, where the smell of death mixed with the putridly sweet air freshener and family members wailed inconsolably over the charred or bloodied remains of those they have lost.
Marwan Saber, a cardiologist, got separated from his brother, Omar, in the melee following the crackdown.
Saber ended up outside the sit-in whereas Omar, a 22-year-old engineer, was shot in the chest inside the protest camp.
x201C;He was stuck in an ambulance x2026; Police wouldnx2019;t let the ambulance leave Rabaa,x201D; said Saber, 26, who was frantic and unable to reach his brother by phone, as mobile networks were not properly functioning during the clashes.
To Saber, there is no such thing as a reasonable loss of life.
x201C;Reasonable? Who would say that? This is reasonable?x201D;
