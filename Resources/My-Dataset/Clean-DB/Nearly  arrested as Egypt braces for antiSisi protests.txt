Egypt is bracing itself for a second weekend of protests on Friday, with authorities stepping up arrests and tightening security in major cities amid calls for a x201C;million-man marchx201D; against PresidentxA0;Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.xA0;
Egyptx2019;s Ministry of Interior warned on Thursday of x201C;decisivex201D; action against any attempts to x201C;destabilise peacex201D; as rights groups say nearly 2,000 people have been arrestedxA0;since last weekendx2019;s rare protests demanding el-Sisi quit.
Among those arrested was Hassan Nafaa, a political science professor at Cairo University and well-known columnist, who called for the presidentx2019;s departure in a Twitter post.xA0;
x201C;I have no doubt that the continuation of el-Sisix2019;s absolute rule will lead to disaster,x201D; Nafaa said. x201C;Egyptx2019;s interest requires his departure today before tomorrow.x201D;

Nafaax2019;s arrest on Wednesday followed the detention of Hazem Hosny, a spokesman for former army chief Sami Anan who was jailed last year for attempting to run against el-Sisi in a presidential election.
Khaled Dawoud, the head of Al-Doustor Party who has been a vocal critic of the presidentx2019;s policies, was also arrested.
Security forces have also deployed more troops to major cities, with police stopping and searching pedestrians on key thoroughfares and squares.xA0;Authorities have also blocked news websites and disrupted access to messaging platforms, according to monitoring groups.
x2018;Friday of Salvationx2019;
Last weekendx2019;s unprecedented display of dissent is a response to calls for action fromxA0;a former Egyptian military contractor,xA0;Mohamed Ali. The part-time actor, who said he worked with the military for 15 years, accused el-Sisi and his aides of squandering public funds on vanity projects despite widespread poverty.xA0;
In a series of videos posted online, he admittedxA0;to benefitting from government corruption, describing how his company, Amlak, was awarded lucrative state contracts without going through the proper bidding process.
Ali, who lives in self-imposed exile in Spain, said he regretted being part of the rampant corruption among the army corps and el-Sisix2019;s relatives, including his wife Entissar Amer.
His description of opulent palaces and luxury hotels that he claimed to have built for el-Sisi x2013; and for which he has yet to be paid x2013; struck a nerve with many Egyptians living under harsh austerity measures imposed under a $12bn loan deal with the International Monetary Fund.
The programme has led to an increase in poverty rates. Official figures show one in three Egyptians live below the poverty line.xA0;
In a new video on Thursday night, Ali called on Egyptians to take to the streets following the noon prayers on Friday. He urged protesters not to clash with security forces and said they should march in side streets. Tahrir Square, the hub of the 2011 uprising that brought down longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, should not be the main focus of Fridayx2019;s protests, he added.
x201C;All the squares in Egypt are Tahrir squares,x201D; he said.xA0;

El-Sisi, who is due back in Cairo on Friday following a trip to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly UNGA, has previously dismissed Alix2019;s allegations as x201C;lies and slanderx201D;.xA0;
Since leading the militaryx2019;s overthrow of democratically-elected PresidentxA0;Mohamed MorsixA0;in 2013, el-Sisi has overseen a broad crackdown against any dissent.
While members of thexA0;Muslim BrotherhoodxA0;x2013; to which Morsi belonged x2013; were the main target of a heavy-handed approach to political dissent, arrests extended well beyond the group. Civil rights activists, journalists, and actors have also been targeted.
When asked about the demonstrations on Monday, el-Sisi blamed them on x201C;political Islamx201D;.xA0;
Nationwide crackdown
Meanwhile on Twitter, hashtags such as x201C;come out you are not alonex201C;, x201C;you are done Sisix201C;, x201C;Sisi must gox201C;, and x201C;Next Fridayx201C;, translated from Arabic, generated tens of thousands of tweets and retweets calling on people to take to the streets peacefully on Friday to demand el-Sisi step down.
EgyptianxA0;Hollywood actorxA0;Amr WakedxA0;posted in Arabic to his almost seven million followers on Thursday: x201C;Sisi is done x2026; it is over for him and anyone who supports him now will be making a huge mistake.x201D;
Addressing el-Sisi directly in thexA0;tweet,xA0;Waked added: x201C;Get smart stupid. Leave and let the people take what belongs to them.x201D;
Analysts and politicians say the Egyptian governmentx2019;s crackdown reflects its insecurity and vulnerability at a critical time as Egyptx2019;s economic woes intensify for the poor and middle class.
x201C;The governmentx2019;s mass arrests and internet restrictions seem intended to scare Egyptians away from protesting and to leave them in the dark about whatx2019;s happening in the country,x201D; said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch.
x201C;The nationwide crackdown on protests suggests that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is terrified of Egyptiansx2019; criticisms.x201D;
Ayman Nour, an Egyptian opposition leader and former presidential candidate, said el-Sisi was alsoxA0;x201C;trying to send a clear message to prominent generals and politicians who might provide an alternative to him.x201D;
Nour said he expects more people will take to the streets now that x201C;the fear barrierx201D; has been broken, saying the governmentx2019;s heavy-handed approach has only heightened peoplex2019;s anger at worsening socioeconomic conditions.
