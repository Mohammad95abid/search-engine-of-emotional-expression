Former US President Barack Obamax2019;s descriptions of Indiax2019;s leaders in his new memoir, A Promised Land, has caused ripples in political circles, with former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh receiving praise.
The book, released on Tuesday, covers his campaign for the White House and his first term in office, during which he visited India when the now-opposition Congress party was in power.
It contains his impressions of then-Prime Minister Singh, party President Sonia Gandhi and her son, Rahul Gandhi.
Obama describes Singh x201C;as a chief architect of Indiax2019;s economic transformationx201D; and x201C;a self-effacing technocrat whox2019;d won peoplex2019;s trust not by appealing to their passions but by bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt.x201D;
Obamax2019;s praise for Singh was welcomed by senior Congress leaders like Shashi Tharoor.

x201C;Rahul Gandhi has a nervous, unformed quality about him as if he were a student whox2019;d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject,x201D; quoted The New York Times from the book.
Rahul Gandhi was defeated twice by Prime Minister Modi in the 2014 and 2019 elections respectively. His grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and father, Rajiv Gandhi, both of whom were assassinated, held the post of prime minister.

Rahul has been a vocal critic of Modi, attacking his government on charges of fanning religious nationalism and favouring business interests.
The last six years of Modi has seen a rise in attacks against minorities, especially Muslims, with dozens of Muslims lynched by Hindu far-right mobs. Critics say a citizenship law passed last December, which sparked nationwide protests, runs counter to the countryx2019;s secular constitution.
