Amnesty International has called on Canadian authorities to arrest and prosecute George W Bush, saying the former US president authorised torture in the course of the United Statesx2019; x201C;war on terrorx201D;.
Bush is expected to attend an economic summit in Surrey in Canadax2019;s westernmost British Columbia province on October 20.
The human rights organisationxA0;said in a statement releasedxA0;on Wednesday thatxA0;the Canadian government has x201C;international obligations x2026; given Bushx2019;s responsibility for crimes under international law including torturex201D;.
The London-based group alsoxA0;released a 27-page memorandum that it had submitted in September to Canadax2019;s attorney general laying out its legal case.
x201C;As the US authorities have, so far, failed to bring former president Bush to justice, the international community must step in,x201D; said Susan Lee, Amnestyx2019;s Americas director, in the statement.
x201C;A failure by Canada to take action during his visit would violate the UN Convention against Torture and demonstrate contempt for fundamental human rights.x201D;
A spokesman for the Canadian government was not immediately available for comment.
Bush cancelled a visit to Switzerland in February after facing similar public calls for his arrest.
x2018;Face justicex2019;
Alex Neve, secretary general of Amnesty Internationalx2019;s Canadian branch, told axA0;newsxA0;conference the rights group will pursue its case against the former US president with the governments of other countries he might visit.
x201C;Torturers must face justice, and their crimes are so egregious that the responsibility for ensuring justice is shared by all nations,x201D; Neve said. 
x201C;Friend or foe, extraordinary or very ordinary times, most or least powerful nation, faced with concerns about terrorism or any other threat, torture must be stopped.x201D;
Amnesty, backed by the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, said Bush authorised the use of x201C;enhanced interrogation techniquesx201D; and x201C;waterboardingx201D; on detainees held in secret by the Central Intelligence Agency between 2002 and 2009.
Bush himself has confirmed he authorised the waterboarding of several individuals.
The detention programme included x201C;torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment such as being forced to stay for hours in painful positions and sleep deprivation, and enforced disappearances,x201D;xA0;Amnesty alleged.
Amnestyx2019;s memorandum relies on the public record, US documents obtained through access to information requests, Bushx2019;s own memoir and a report from the International Committee of the Red Cross critical ofxA0;US counter terrorism policies.
The organisationxA0;cites several instances of alleged torture of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay naval facility, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, by the US military.
They include that of Zayn al Abidin Muhammed Husayn known as Abu Zubaydah and allegedxA0;September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, both arrested in Pakistan. 
The two men were waterboarded 266 times between them from 2002 to 2003, according to the CIA inspector general, cited by Amnesty.
