London Mayor Boris Johnson has caused controversy in the United Kingdom by claiming that US President Barack Obama has an x201C;ancestral dislikex201D; for Britain as a result of his x201C;part-Kenyanx201D; heritage.
His comments came after Obama, on a London visit, angered proponents of a so-called Brexit by saying the UK is better off by staying in the European Union.
In an opinion essay published in the right-leaning tabloid The Sun, the mayor criticised Obamax2019;s eagerness to urge British voters to remain in the EU and argued that the president may be x201C;anti- Britishx201D;.
Johnson, who is seen as the unofficial leader of the campaign for the UK to leave the EU, claimed in his article that Obama removed a bust of Britainx2019;s war-time prime minister Sir Winston Churchill from the Oval Office shortly after he became president in 2009.

I love Winston Churchill. Love the guy.
Barack Obama


x201C;Some said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan presidentx2019;s ancestral dislike of the British empire x2013; of which Churchill had been such a fervent defenderx201D; wrote the London mayor.
However, his remarks about Obamax2019;s heritage did not score Johnson any points in the EU discussions. Instead, he was branded x201C;racistx201D; by several prominent MPs.
Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames, who is the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, said Johnsonx2019;s comments were x201C;appallingx201D; and x201C;totally wrong on almost everythingx201D;.
x201C;Time and time again, his judgment is awry and he shows in this article a remarkable disregard for the facts, the truth and for all judgment,x201D; he told LBC radio. x201C;I donx2019;t think Boris has the stature to be leader.x201D;
Sir Nicholas also said it was inconceivable that Churchill would not have welcomed the views of Obama.

OPINION: Brexit and the failure of the EU project

John McDonnell, Labour Partyx2019;s shadow chancellor, suggested that Johnsonx2019;s remarks were x201C;racistx201D;.
x201C;Mask slips again,x201D; he tweeted. x201C;Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog-whistle racism from senior Tories. He should withdraw it.x201D;
Support for the mayor, however, came from UKIP party leader Nigel Farage, who also campaigns for UK to leave the EU. The far-right party leader said Obama should x201C;butt outx201D;.
Accusing him of being the most anti-British American president in history, the far-right party leader told the Radio 4x2019;s World at One programme: x201C;I think Obama, because of his grandfather and Kenya and colonisation, I think Obama bears a bit of a grudge against this country.x201D;
 x2018;I love Churchillx2019; 
Obama responded to Johnsonx2019;s comments on his alleged x201C;ancestral dislikex201D; for Britain in a press conference on Friday.
Talking next to British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama said he loved Churchill and still had a bust of the British leader in his White House private residence.
x201C;Right outside the door of the Treaty Room, so that I see it every day x2013; including on weekends when Ix2019;m going into that office to watch a basketball game x2013; the primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill,x201D; he said.
x201C;Itx2019;s there voluntarily because I can do anything on the second floor. I love Winston Churchill. Love the guy.x201D;
Obama said there was a bust of Churchill in the Oval Office during the presidency of his predecessor George W Bush but he decided that he would have a bust of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King in his office instead.
x201C;I thought it was appropriate x2013; and I think most people in the United Kingdom might agree x2013; that as the first African-American president, it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr Martin Luther King in my office,x201D; he said.
