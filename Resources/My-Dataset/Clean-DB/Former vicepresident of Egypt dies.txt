He was 87. 
El-Shafie, born in the Nile Delta city of Tanta in 1918, died on Friday morning at his home after a long illness, his nephew Nadia el-Shafie told The Associated Press. 
El-Shafie was an officer in the Egyptian military during the 1948 war between the Arabs and Israel, and like many returned disillusioned with Egyptx2019;s King Farouq after the Arabsx2019; losses. 
He joined Gamal Abdel Nasser in the Free Officers Movement, a group of military officers who toppled the king in 1952. Abdel Nasser, who became president, elevated el-Shafie to war minister in 1954. He led the court that tried members of the Muslim Brotherhood after an alleged assassination attempt against Abdel Nasser that same year.

Abdel Nasserx2019;s successor Anwar al-Sadat named el-Shafie vice-president in 1970 but removed him five years later after el-Shafie opposed Sadatx2019;s policies towards Israel. 
El-Shafie sharply opposed al-Sadatx2019;s 1979 peace deal with Israel. 
Al-Sadat replaced el-Shafie as vice-president with Hosni Mubarak, who rose to the presidency after al-Sadatx2019;s assassination in 1981. 
El-Shafiex2019;s funeral will be on Saturday.
