President-elect Joe Biden said his transition x201C;should be further alongx201D; and President Donald Trumpx2019;s refusal to acknowledge the outcome of the 2020 election is creating problems in the nationx2019;s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
x201C;Therex2019;s a whole lot of things that are just x2013; we just donx2019;t have available to us, which unless made available soon, wex2019;re going to be behind by weeks or months,x201D; President-elect Biden said in a virtual meeting with front-line healthcare workers.
Biden, who is the apparent winner of the election, faulted the Trump administration for not following US law providing for a cooperative transition between presidents.
x201C;What wex2019;re having now is the failure of the administration to recognise what the law says,x201D; Biden said.
As a result, x201C;wex2019;ve been unable to get access to the kinds of things we need to know,x201D; he said.
The Trump administration is preventing Bidenx2019;s incoming team from learning about stockpiles of personal protective equipment PPE, he said. x201C;We know therex2019;s not much at all.x201D;
Importantly, Biden said his transition team is being prevented from learning what the plan is for distributing vaccines as they become available.
Two vaccine makers have announced positive results from large-scale clinical trials. The Trump administration has prepared a plan called x201C;Operation Warp Speedx201D; in which doses of the vaccines have been manufactured in advance and will be distributed by the US military.
Bidenx2019;s remarks came in a virtual conference with representatives of doctors, nurses and first responders organised by his transition team.

He faulted Trump for failing to allow an orderly transition xA0;Tom Brenner/ReutersBiden said he was hopeful that Republicans in Congress, where talks on a coronavirus spending package are stalled, will be more willing to send money to state and local governments after Trump leaves office.
Biden promised to make funding for states and localities a priority when he takes office in January and suggested Republicans have resisted including local funding in a pandemic-relief package x201C;because of their fear of retribution from the presidentx201D;.
x201C;Hopefully, when hex2019;s gone, theyx2019;ll be more willing to do what they know should be done, has to be done, in order to save the communities they live in,x201D; Biden said.
States are facing enormous financial shortfalls as a result of lost tax revenue related to the pandemic that may threaten local healthcare systems, law enforcement and education.
Meanwhile, legislators on both sides of the aisle were criticised by a Wall Street titan, who urged Republicans and Democrats to split their differences and cut a deal.
x201C;This is childish behaviour on the part of our politicians,x201D; JPMorgan Chase amp; Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a New York Times conference.
x201C;Just get it done,x201D; Dimon said.
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon scolded US legislators for failing to agree on an economic stimulus package File: Jeenah Moon/ReutersDemocrats have proposed a compromise $2.2-trillion spending package, while Senate Republicans have sought a narrower $500bn bill that Democrats have said is inadequate.
x201C;Our colleagues face a simple choice. They put the election behind them and work across the aisle to get something done, or they can remain in their partisan corner,x201D; Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.
Before the November 3 election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tried but failed to agree on a relief package of approximately $2 trillion.
Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who favours a $500bn package, said Congress should aim for agreement on items where there is already compromise.
x201C;Republicans stand ready to deliver this urgent aid. Letx2019;s fund all the programmes where therex2019;s not even real disagreement. Just this once, where therex2019;s no disagreement. And letx2019;s do it now. We just need Democrats to finally get serious about this,x201D; McConnell said.
