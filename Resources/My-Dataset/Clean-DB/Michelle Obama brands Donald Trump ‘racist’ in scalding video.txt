Former US First Lady Michelle Obama has launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump, calling him a x201C;racistx201D; president whose strategy of fear-mongering, division and promoting ugly conspiracy theories could x201C;destroyx201D; the United States if he is re-elected.
In a 24-minute video offering closing arguments for Democratic White House nominee Joe Biden four weeks before election day on November 3, Obama described Trump and his Republican allies as unfairly x201C;stoking fearsx201D; about Black Americans.
Obama also accused him of x201C;willful mismanagementx201D; of the coronavirus crisis, noting that more Americans have died from COVID-19 than died in the Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and Korean wars combined. x201C;Our commander-in-chief,x201D; she said, x201C;sadly, has been missing in action.x201D;
x2018;Trump spreading liesx2019;
In order to x201C;distract from his breathtaking failuresx201D;, Obama said Trump was x201C;morally wrongx201D; for taking actions that intimidate voters and for x201C;lying about how minorities will destroy the suburbsx201D;.

My heart goes out to everyone touched by this virus, from those at the White House, especially the Secret Service and residence staff whose service ought never be taken for granted, to all those names and stories most of us will unfortunately never know. https://t.co/dtEUrcjPAy

x201C;What the president is doing is once again patently false, itx2019;s morally wrong, and yes, it is racist,x201D; said the 56-year-old wife of Barack Obama, the first Black US president from 2009 to 2016.
But, she warned, such tactics have the potential to work, particularly because Americans lack the time and energy to fact-check everything being spread online or in US media.
x201C;Because this is a difficult time, a confusing time, and when people hear these lies and crazy conspiracies repeated over and over and over again, they donx2019;t know what to think,x201D; she said.
x201C;And the one thing this president is really, really good at is using fear and confusion, and spreading lies to win,x201D; Obama added.
Trump has declared himself the x201C;law and orderx201D; president and has repeatedly slammed those protesting against racial injustice as violent x201C;extremistsx201D;.
Obamax2019;s video targets a wide range of voters. Along with speaking to x201C;Black and brown folks,x201D; she urged white Americans to imagine x201C;the millions of folks who look like me, and fought and died and toiled as slaves and soldiers and labourers to help build this country.x201D;
Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden are due to take part in the second presidential debate on October 15 Brian Snyder/ReutersObamax2019;s remarks took a personal turn. As a Black woman, like the majority of those in the country, having x201C;done everything in my power to live a life of dignity and service and honesty, the knowledge that any of my fellow Americans is more afraid of me than the chaos that we are living through right now, well that hurts,x201D; she said.
x201C;It is a heaviness that sits on our hearts.x201D;
Obama also criticised Trumpx2019;s belittling of US military personnel as x201C;losersx201D; and his devotion to x201C;enriching himselfx201D; and wealthy cronies.
Biden, she said, x201C;offers contrasting values aimed at helping working-class families, healing divisions and protecting the environment.x201D;
Search your hearts and your conscience, and then vote for Joe Biden like your lives depend on it,x201D; she said.
