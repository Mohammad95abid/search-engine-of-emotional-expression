President Donald TrumpxA0;has said deploying the US military to Venezuela is x201C;an optionx201D;.
x201C;Well, I donx2019;t want to say that. But certainly, itx2019;s something thatx2019;s on the x2013; itx2019;s an option,x201D; Trump said on CBSx2019;s Face the Nation programme on Sunday when asked if he would use the American forces during Venezuelax2019;s crisis.xA0;
The US recognised Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president on January 23, and is leading an international campaign to drivexA0;Nicolas Maduro from office.
Trump also said MaduroxA0;requested a meeting with him x201C;a number of months agox201D; but he declined it.

x201C;I decided at the time x2018;nox2019; because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela,x201D; he said, citing the x201C;poverty, anguish, and crimex201D; in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in Latin America.
Trump again praised Guaido describing him as x201C;a young and energetic gentlemanx201D;.xA0;
x201C;If you talk about democracy x2013; itx2019;s really democracy in actionx2026;xA0;I think the process is playing out x2013; very, very big tremendous protests.x201D;
Four major European nations x2013; Britain, France, Germany and Spain x2013; said they will recognise Guaido unless Maduro calls new presidential elections by midnight on Sunday.
Trump has repeatedly warned x201C;all options are on the tablex201D; in Venezuela, as his administration ramps up pressure on Maduro through economic sanctions and appeals to the countryx2019;s armed forces to switch allegiances.

x2018;Point of no returnx2018;
The US, Canada and several Latin American countries have disavowed Maduro over his disputed re-election last year and also recognised Guaido as the interim president.
Maduro, however, maintains the powerful backing of Russia, China and Turkey. Russian foreign minister said on Sunday that Western meddling was instigating Venezuelax2019;s troubles and punishing millions of its people.
x201C;Venezuela has reached a point of no return,x201D; political analyst Marco Terugi told Al Jazeera. x201C;We now have a government that was democratically elected, and a parallel government controlled and led by the US.x201D;xA0;
Russiax2019;s foreign ministry said on Sunday the international community should focus on helping to solve Venezuelax2019;s economic and social problems and refrain from any x201C;destructivex201D; interference.
x201C;The international communityx2019;s goal should be to help without destructive meddling from beyond its borders,x201D; Alexander Shchetinin, head of the ministryx2019;s Latin American department, was cited by Interfax news agency as saying.
Journalist Robert Valencia from Global Voices said global geopolitics could be coming to a head, noting Russia deployed two nuclear-capable bombers toxA0;the Latin American nation in December x2013; a move that riled the US.xA0;
x201C;I think wex2019;re talking about a new tug-of-war between two current powers in the world x2013; the United States and Russia. We are seeing something that has happened in Syria and now could be moved into Venezuelax2026; This is going to be a new struggle for the balance of power,x201D; he said.xA0; xA0; xA0;
At a crossroadxA0;
Tens of thousands of people thronged the streets of various Venezuelan cities on Saturday to protest his government and a senior air force general recognised Guaido.

The Trump administration last week issued crippling sanctions that are likely to further weaken the countryx2019;s struggling oil industry x2013; by far Venezuelax2019;s greatest source of income.
While that could weaken Maduro, it risks also exacerbating Venezuelax2019;s economic collapse.
Venezuela is suffering medicine shortages, malnutrition and hyperinflation that has prompted millions to emigrate in recent years.
