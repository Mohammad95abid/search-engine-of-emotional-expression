Cairo, Egypt x2013; After decades of being an underground group, Egyptx2019;s Muslim Brotherhood finally got its chance to realise its dream of mainstream appeal, and rise to power through the countryx2019;s first presidential elections, which followedxA0;the 2011 toppling of Hosni Mubarak.
The Brotherhoodx2019;s Mohamed Morsi, who was not initially the groupx2019;s preferred presidential candidate, narrowly won a run-off vote against Ahmed Shafiq, a former Mubarak aide.
Seen by many voters as the better of two bad options, Morsi managed to secure a fraction more than half of the total votes, and was the republicx2019;s first elected civilian president.
So far, luck was on his side. He had managed to escape from prison, where he had been held during the revolution, and was now running the country.
He was quick to forget, however, that many x2013; including those who supported him in the race x2013; were hungry for change.
One eventful year into his four-year tenure, Morsix2019;s rule was shattered beneath the feet of millions who took to the streets demanding his resignation.
With the armyx2019;s backing, the Brotherhoodx2019;s dream was short-lived. On Wednesday, Morsi will stand trial over the jailbreak that freed him, as well as accusations of killing protesters and collaborating with Hamas and Hezbollah to carry out x201C;terrorist conspiraciesx201D; against Egypt.
He could face the death penalty over the charges.
