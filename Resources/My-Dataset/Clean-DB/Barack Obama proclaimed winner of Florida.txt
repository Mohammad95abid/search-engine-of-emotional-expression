Barack Obama, the US president, has won Floridax2019;s 29 electoral votes in the 2012 US presidential election.
Saturdayx2019;s announcement comes four days after the then incumbent was declared the winner of presidential polls in the election last Tuesday after having secured 303 electoral votes.
x201C;Florida has spoken loudly in support of moving our nation forward,x201D; Ashley Walker, the Obama campaignx2019;s director for Florida, said in a news release making reference to the incumbentx2019;s campaign slogan.
She added that the win was a testament to the campaignx2019;s volunteers and staff.
The Florida Secretary of Statex2019;s Office said that with almost 100 per cent of the vote counted, Obama led Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, 50 per cent to 49.1 per cent, a difference of about 74,000 votes.
That was over the half-per cent margin where a computer recount would have been automatically ordered unless Romney had waived it.
Florida was the last of the nationx2019;s 50 states to declare official results for the election of the countryx2019;s forty-fifth president.
The deadline for Tallahassee, the statex2019;s capital, to report vote totals in the statex2019;s 67 counties was noon 1700GMT on Saturday.
Exit polls conducted for The Associated Press news agency showed Obama was favoured by more than 9 of 10 black voters and 3 of 5 Latino voters in Florida. The president also was the choice of two-thirds of voters under age 30.
Romney, who was left with 206 electoral votes in the fiinal tally, led among both white and older voters.
