Libyax2019;s UN-recognised Government of National Accord GNA has denounced Egyptx2019;s warning of military intervention in Libya, labelling it a x201C;declaration of warx201D;.
On Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi warned that if pro-GNA forces advanced on the strategic city of Sirte x2013; some 450 kilometres 280 miles east of the capital Tripoli x2013; it could provoke a x201C;directx201D; intervention by Cairo.
He also ordered the Egyptian army to be ready to carry out missions inside or outside of the country to protect its national security amid tensions over Turkeyx2019;s intervention in Libya.
In response, the GNA said in a statement that Egyptx2019;s move was x201C;a hostile act andxA0;direct interference, and amounts to a declaration of warx201D;.
The statement comes on the eve of a virtual meeting of Arab League foreign ministers on Libya, in which the GNA declined to participate.
For the Libyan state, x201C;interference in its internal affairs, attacks on its sovereignty, whether by declarations x2026; like those of the Egyptian president or by support for putschists, militias and mercenaries, is unacceptablex201D;, the GNA said.
It said it was open to x201C;all impartial mediation x2026; under the aegis of the UNx201D; but rejected x201C;unilateral or extrajudicial initiativesx201D;.



Oil-rich Libya has been mired in chaos since a NATO-backed 2011 uprising toppled longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi.
Since 2015, a power struggle has pitted the Tripoli-based GNA against renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, who claims legitimacy from an eastern-based elected parliament.
Haftar has been trying unsuccessfully to seize the capital since April 2019, with support from Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.

Since the start of June, increased Turkish support has enabled pro-GNA forces toxA0; take control of northwest Libya, ending Haftarx2019;s assault on Tripoli.
The GNA advance is now halted outside the coastal city of Sirte, a strategic access point to Libyax2019;s key oil fields which remains under Haftarx2019;s control.
Sirte and Al-Jufra to the south represent a x201C;red linex201D;, el-Sisi said in a television broadcast on Saturday, citing the need to protect Egyptx2019;s porous border.
If this line is crossed, Egyptian forces will directly intervene in Libya, el-Sisi said.
x201C;All of Libya is a red line,x201D; the GNA responded. x201C;Whatever the dispute between Libyans, we will not allow our people to be insulted or threatened.x201D;
But the speaker of Libyax2019;s eastern-based parliament, Aguila Saleh, defended el-Sisix2019;s declaration, saying in a Sunday statement that the Egyptian president was x201C;responding to our appeal to the Egyptian parliamentx201D; last January in which Saleh called for Egyptian intervention in Libya.
And on Sunday, the Jordanian foreign ministry issued a statement saying Amman supports Cairo x201C;against any threat to the security and stabilityx201D; of Egypt.
It came after the foreign ministers of both countries discussed the Libya conflict over the phone.
