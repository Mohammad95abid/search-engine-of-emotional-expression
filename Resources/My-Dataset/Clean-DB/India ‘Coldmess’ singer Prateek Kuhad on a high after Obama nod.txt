Starting out, Indian singer Prateek Kuhad gave himself one year to make it. He is still no stranger to self-doubt x2013; but now even Barack Obama is a fan of his heartbreak-inspired songs.
The 29-year-old was enjoying a quiet New Yearx2019;s Eve at his family home in capital New Delhi when he received a message saying: x201C;This is big.x201D;
Former US President Obama had included Kuhadx2019;s wistful hit x201C;cold/messx201D; in his annual list of favourite music, alongside the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce and Lizzo.

From hip-hop to country to The Boss, here are my songs of the year. If youx2019;re looking for something to keep you company on a long drive or help you turn up a workout, I hope therex2019;s a track or two in here that does the trick. pic.twitter.com/mQ2VssyDwt

x2018;Obama scouts his music wellx2019;
x201C;Itx2019;s cool,x201D; Kuhad told AFP news agency, adding that being mentioned in Obamax2019;s viral Twitter and Instagram posts was still x201C;overwhelmingx201D;.
x201C;He is one of the few personalities in our generation who has got a fairly clean image, is one of the good presidents that the world has seen,x201D; he said.
x201C;He listens to Big Thief. I love them, but theyx2019;re not a really big band. It clearly looks like Obama scouts his music well.x201D;
Kuhad is not sure how Obama first heard his music but links it to his 2019 tour across North America and Europe that helped him break through internationally, but tested his resolve.
x201C;I almost hated performing when I started doing it. Ix2019;m getting used to it only now,x201D; he said.
He describes the track picked by the ex-president as a x201C;straight-up heartbreak songx201D;, saying he accepts that writing about romance, longing and the complications of love has helped him find fame.
x201C;People would say this is all I can write about. You question yourself, and I did have such a moment in mid-2019. But then I realised I loved what I do,x201D; he said.
Enormous boost
Kuhad had a comfortable upbringing in the northern Indian desert city of Jaipur before studying maths and economics at New York University.
When he decided to take up music professionally in 2013, he struggled while other paths beckoned.
x201C;I gave myself a year. I was ready to quit x2013; I knew I could either land a job or study further if my music career didnx2019;t take off,x201D; he said.
Since then he has released four well-received albums, including x201C;cold/messx201D;, named after the song that caught Obamax2019;s attention.
He thinks being an artist in the digital age boosted his chances of reaching a wider, non-Indian audience with a track that is x201C;pretty much an alternative, pop English songx201D;.
Not being dependent on record-label executives has helped him break into an industry where x201C;there have been only a certain kind of pop stars, and primarily white peoplex201D;.
Kuhad has already built up a solid following and gets frequent requests for selfies in public, but he knows his global visibility has been given an enormous boost by Obama.
The media frenzy following the end-of-year list means the singer now has to rethink his 2020 plans.
As he decides his next steps, hex2019;ll be listening to British pop veteran Cliff Richard, Pakistanx2019;s Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, or Mozart.
Kuhad x2013; who describes himself as cynical, cautious and risk-averse x2013; said the personal experiences that inspire his songwriting, as well as x201C;skills, hard work and disciplinex201D;, have got him where he is today.
x201C;In 2014, I used a platform which allowed me to send emails to myself in the future.
x201C;A day after Obamax2019;s list came out, I got a mail which I had written then that said I should quit if I wasnx2019;t successful by now,x201D; Kuhad said, laughing.
x201C;I think Ix2019;m doing okay.x201D;
