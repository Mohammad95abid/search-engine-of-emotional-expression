Pressure has been building on the Nelson Mandela Foundation to withdraw an invitation to former US President Barack Obama who is scheduled to travel to South Africa next month to deliver the NGOx2019;s annual lecture, which this year marks the late anti-apartheid iconx2019;s birth centennial.
In an open letter, the Cage Africa advocacy group said that during his eight-year tenure as president and commander-in-chief of the US army, Obama was directly responsible for a massive expansion of US military operations in Africa, including special operations and drone attacks.
x201C;Giving this man a platform would be tantamount to condoning these actions, something that Nelson Mandela would surely have stood against,x201D; the letter, published earlier this month, read.
x201C;This is especially pertinent given Nelson Mandelax2019;s legacy as an individual who was also once designated a x2018;terroristx2019; and suffered torture and imprisonment as a result, and who despite this is now regarded as one of the pre-eminent figureheads for justice around the world.x201D;
The NGOx2019;s 16th annual lecture is scheduled for July 17 in Johannesburg. An estimated 9,000 people are anticipated to attend the event, in which Obama is expected to speak on x201C;Renewing the Mandela Legacy and Promoting Active Citizenship in a Changing Worldx201D;.
Karen Jayes, Cage Africa spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that failing to rescind the invitation would cement a belief that the Nelson Mandela Foundation x201C;is part of what many see as the x2018;whitewashingx2019; of Mandelax2019;s legacyx201D;.

Responding to the criticisms from Cage Africa, the Nelson Mandela Foundation would not say if they were reconsidering their invitation, but admitted that they were x201C;taking the concerns seriouslyx201D;.
Spokesperson Lunga Nene told Al Jazeera that Obama had been selected as part of the Foundationx2019;s special focus on legacy, given that 2018 marks 100 years since Mandelax2019;s birth.
Nene said that it was clear that Mandela, a former president and a hero in the struggle against apartheid South Africa, had held x201C;great respect for President Obamax201D;.
x201C;As a legacy institution we also have had to grapple with the contestation of Madibax2019;s legacy, particularly from younger people,x201D; added Nene, using the clan name by which Mandela was widely known in South Africa.
x201C;Both leaders were challenged by difficult circumstances during their time in office, and both reflected on mistakes and regrets after leaving office. We have asked President Obama to address these issues,x201D; Nene said.
Obamax2019;s record
The 2009 election of Obama, the USx2019; first black president, met much optimism across Africa. The belief at the time was that Obama, whose father was born in Kenya, would be personally invested on the continent.
But by the end of his presidency, observers said Obama had failed to live up to the expectations and deliver a substantial legacy, citing vague policies and a continuation of a paternalistic approach towards Africa that ultimately prioritised security over economic partnership and investment.

Oumar Ba, professor of international relations in Morehouse, Atlanta, told Al Jazeera Obama would be remembered for x201C;the militarisation of US foreign policy on the African continent, his use of drones, his immigration policy and his disastrous intervention in Libyax201D;.
In a 2015 speech at the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia, Obama called on some of the continentx2019;s elder statesmen to step down. But critics said the president of the US had x201C;no moral right to lecture Africansx201D;, dismissing what they said appeared to be a tone-deaf message given his countryx2019;s continued support for some of the continentx2019;s autocratic leaders.
x201C;Obama pursued the same predatory and criminal policies that provoked international anger and hatred under his predecessor George W Bush,x201D; Ibrahim Vawda, of the South Africa-based Media Review Network, said in a statement also calling the Nelson Mandela Foundation to withdraw its invitation.
x201C;His stated theme of promoting x2018;democracyx2019; in Africa was absurd and hypocritical.x201D;
In response to questions seeking comment on the developing concerns in South Africa in advance of the July event, a spokesperson for the Obama Foundation only said that they were looking forward to the former presidentx2019;s lecture, describing it x201C;as an opportunity to discuss creating conditions for bridging divides, working across ideological lines, and resisting oppression and inequalityx201D;.
Mandelax2019;s legacy
Nax2019;eem Jeenah, director of the Johannesburg-based Afro-Middle East Centre AMEC, said Obama was an apparently carefully made choice by the Nelson Mandela Foundation.
x201C;I suspect that the foundation will argue that they choose speakers with whom they do not necessarily agree, but who will be able to drive forward debate and discussion on critical issues facing the world today,x201D; Jeenah said.
Jeenah added that it was not surprising that there was opposition to the event. He expected the dissent to increase in the coming days.
x201C;The argument is that Obama, through his actions as president, most certainly does not represent Mandelax2019;s legacy x2026; and the past decade of Obamax2019;s life does not suggest to us that he has the credentials to talk about renewing Mandelax2019;s legacy or that he has been active in promoting active citizenship x2013; either in his own country or abroad,x201D; he said.
But Ottilia Anna Maunganidze, head of Special Projects at the Institute of Security Studies ISS in Pretoria, said that while she had no qualms about Obamax2019;s lecture, she agreed that the event deserved the scrutiny it was currently receiving.

x201C;He no longer wields state power but calls for accountability should not be limited to people still in office.
x201C;It is important that beyond rhetoric, that Obama reflects critically on the negative issues people raise as well. Of course, whether such a platform isnx2019;t better-placed for an African leader x2013; political or otherwise x2013; to address is another issue altogether,x201D; Maunganidze told Al Jazeera.
Nene, from the Mandela Foundation, said it is not the first time the Foundation has been criticised for their choice of speaker.

In 2015, the NGO received complaints about inviting economist Thomas Piketty, while in 2016, there were concerns over the decision to call Bill Gates.
Other past speakers include former US President Bill Clinton, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
Jeenah, from AMEC, said despite the impossibility of making everyone happy, critics were unanimous on one point.
x201C;At the very least, they critics believe that the speaker, especially on Mandelax2019;s 100th birthday, should be someone who actually does represent Mandelax2019;s legacy, and it should preferably be an African.x201D;
