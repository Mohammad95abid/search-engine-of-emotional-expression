World leaders on Saturday began congratulating Joe Biden on winning the White House, shortly after several media outlets in the United States called the presidential race in his favour.
The Democratic candidate, 77, was projected to have surpassed the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win his hard-fought matchup with incumbent Donald Trump. The 74-year-old Republican has not conceded defeat and vowed to pursue a number of legal challenges in several battleground states.
