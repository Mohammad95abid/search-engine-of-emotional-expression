An Egyptian court hasxA0;fined ousted president Hosni Mubarak and former officialsxA0;more thanxA0;$90m for cutting off access to internet and mobile phone services during the countryx2019;s massive protests in January.
A court source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that Mubarakx2019;s fine is $34m, former interior minister Habib al-Adly will owe $53m, and former prime minister Ahmed Nazif has a fine of $7m.
The amounts relate to compensation for lost revenue as a result of the decision to cut off access for five days starting on January 28, said the source.
The fine is to be paid from personal assets, and the state has the right to increase the amount over the year if damages continue to rise.
This was the first court ruling against Mubarak since he was ousted on February 11.
Mubarak faces far more serious charges, including ordering the killing of protesters, a charge which could carry the death penalty.
