An Egyptian court has acquitted a senior official from former president Hosni Mubarakx2019;s governmentxA0;on corruption charges, inxA0;the latest ruling to clear a prominent figure from the ousted leaderx2019;s era.
Habib al-Adly was cleared ofxA0;illegally amassing $23m and was expected be x201C;released soon,x201D;xA0;his lawyer and state media said on Thursday.
Adly, who served as interior minister and oversaw the countryx2019;s police force, wasxA0;acquittedxA0;last year along with Mubarak and six others on charges relating to the deaths of protesters during 2011 that helpedxA0;lead to the governmentx2019;s downfall.
Last month, an appeals court overturned a suspended five-year sentence against Adly and former premier Ahmed Nazif over other corruption charges.
While the courts have been gradually absolving Mubarak-era officials, they have been handing down lengthy sentences to liberal and Islamist activists in cases ranging from protesting to committing acts of violence.
Morsi was ousted in 2013 by then army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was subsequently elected as his successor.
