Egypt is accusing the United Nations of seeking to x201C;politicisex201D; the death in court of the countryx2019;s first democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi by calling for an x201C;independent inquiryx201D;.
Foreign ministry spokesperson Ahmed Hafez said on Wednesday he condemned x201C;in the strongest termsx201D; the call byxA0;Rupert Colville,xA0;spokesperson for the UN high commissioner for human rights, for an independent investigation into Morsix2019;s death on Monday.
Hafez said it was a x201C;deliberate attempt to politicise a case of natural deathx201D;.
Egyptx2019;s first official comments on Morsix2019;s death came amid growing criticism about prison conditions in the Middle East nation.
On Tuesday, Colville called for a probe into whether the conditions Morsi faced during his nearly six years in custody had contributed to his death.

x201C;Any sudden death in custody must be followed by a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body to clarify the cause of death,x201D; he said. 
x201C;Concerns have been raised regarding the conditions of Mr Morsix2019;s detention, including access to adequate medical care, as well as sufficient access to his lawyers and family,x201D; Colville added. 
He said the investigation must x201C;encompass all aspects of the authoritiesx2019; treatment of Mr Morsi to examine whether the conditions of his detention had an impact on his death.x201D;
Morsi was buried in a small family ceremony early on Tuesday a day after he suffered a fatal heart attack in a Cairo court, his sons said.
Morsi was overthrown on July 3, 2013, after barely a year in power, in a coup staged by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.xA0;He was placed under house arrest before being moved to prison.

Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also called for a credible investigation into Morsix2019;s death.
x201C;The government of Egypt today bears responsibility for his death, given their failure to provide him with adequate medical care or basic prisoner rights,x201D; HRW said in a statement to Al Jazeera.
x201C;Hex2019;s been in prison and treated worse than the already terrible conditions for Egyptx2019;s prisoners,x201D; Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of HRWx2019;s Middle East and North Africa division, told Al Jazeera, decrying Morsix2019;s x201C;terrible but entirely predictablex201D; death.
x201C;The Egyptian government has known very clearly about his declining medical state. He had lost a great deal of weight, he had fainted in court a number of times and was being kept in almost around-the-clock solitary confinement.x201D;

A leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood group, Morsi won Egyptx2019;s first free presidential election in 2012, a year after an uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.
Turkeyx2019;s ruling AK Party supported Morsix2019;s government and the country hosted many Brotherhood members and supporters who fled to Turkey since the groupx2019;s activities were banned in Egypt in 2013.
x201C;There are Arab dissidents x2026; in Turkey since the Arab Spring x2026; and people are here to give support for Morsix2019;s cause,x201D; said Al Jazeerax2019;s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbulx2019;s Fatih Mosque where thousands had come, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to attend a prayer service for Morsi.
At the time of his death, Morsi, 67, faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with many human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.
Thousands of members of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, who were arrested in the crackdown following the 2013 coup, are still languishing in jails.
Egyptx2019;s government has dismissed accusations that the former president was badly treated.
