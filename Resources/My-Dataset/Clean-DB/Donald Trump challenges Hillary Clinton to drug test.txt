Donald Trump has challenged Hillary Clinton to a drug test before their next debate, suggesting the Democrat was x201C;pumped upx201D; on performance-enhancing drugs.
The attack from the Republican nominee came as he accused x201C;corruptx201D; media of seeking to rig Novemberx2019;s vote in his Democratic rivalx2019;s favour, by reporting snowballing claims of his sexual misconduct.
Trump has trampled on all conventions in his treatment of his opponent, vowing if elected to jail her over her email practices as secretary of state x2013; and making x201C;Lock Her Upx201D; a rallying cry for his supporters.
His campaign has actively bruited theories about Clintonx2019;s health, seizing on her bout of pneumonia last month to suggest she is concealing a major health problem, and is unfit for office.

In a new attack, he suggested she had taken drugs before their last debate, and called for her to be tested ahead of their final duel on Wednesday in Las Vegas.
x201C;I donx2019;t know what is going on with her,x201D; Trump, 70, told a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
x201C;At the beginning of her last debate, she was all pumped up at the beginning. At the end, it was like, x2018;Take me down.x2019; She could barely reach her car.
x201C;Athletes, they make them take a drug test. I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate. Why donx2019;t we do that?x201D;
Saturdayx2019;s attack on his Democratic rival marked yet another escalation of Trumpx2019;s electoral strategy heading into the final weeks of a race that has defied all political norms.
As Trump falls in the polls x2013; abandoned by part of his own camp x2013; he has spent the week claiming the media and a x201C;global elitex201D; are working against him, alleging that Clinton plotted to destroy the sovereignty of the US.
x201C;Hillary is running for president in what looks like a rigged election,x201D; he charged in New Hampshire.
x201C;The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president.x201D;
Unwanted advances
Ten women have now come forward to say they were the victim of unwanted advances by Trump.
He vehemently denies the womenx2019;s allegations.
For her part, Clinton has scaled back her campaign commitments, keeping a low profile as Trump battles the allegations, set off by the release last week of a video of him bragging about groping women.
But the Clinton camp issued a prompt response to Trumpx2019;s latest comments on the election, accusing him of seeking to erode public faith in the vote.
In a statement, Robby Mook, Clintonx2019;s campaign manager,xA0;said:xA0;x201C;This election will have record turnout, because voters see through Donald Trumpx2019;s shameful attempts to undermine an election weeks before it happens.x201D;
