An opposition coalition of left-leaning and secular parties in Egypt has called for the immediate release of a former diplomat who was arrested after calling for a referendum on President Abdel Fattah el-Sisix2018;s government.
Maasoum Marzouk was arrested on Thursday along with two others and ordered to remain in custody for 15 days pending an investigation into terror-related charges.xA0;
Marzouk and the other detainees x2013; economist Raied Salama and Yehia al-Qazzaz, a geology professor x2013; were accused by state-run media of cooperating with the bannedxA0;Muslim BrotherhoodxA0;group, which Egyptx2019;s government designated as a x201C;terroristx201D; group in 2013.
On Monday, the Civil Democratic Movement coalition said in a press conference that the arrests were x201C;part of the government crackdown to silence opposition voicesx201D;.
At the press conference, Mohammed Anwar Sadat, nephew of Egyptx2019;s former leader Anwar Sadat, called for x201C;genuine political reformx201D; and x201C;for the President and the state to listenx201D; to the opposition.
Marzouk, who was assistant minister of foreign affairs under former President Hosni Mubarak, served in the Egyptian armyx2019;s special forces and is a veteran of the 1973 war with Israel.

He is also a former Egyptian ambassador to Uganda, Finland and Estonia.
More recently, he helped to form the The Peoplex2019;s Democratic Party and served as an adviser and spokesman for the presidential campaign ofxA0;Hamdeen Sabbahi, a left-wing candidate who ran against Sisi in the 2014 elections.
Speaking at Mondayx2019;s press conference, Sabbahi called for change, saying Sisix2019;s government had failed.
x201C;We believe that this regime must be changed,x201D; he said. x201C;This is a failed power. This is a repressive power x2026; which violated and insulted the constitution.x201D;
In a statement on August 5, Marzouk called for protests in Tahrir Square in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, saying that if his initiative was not accepted, he would hold a x201C;popular conferencex201D; there.
The Square was the epicentre of the 2011 mass uprising that led to the downfall of Mubarak.xA0;
He had also campaigned for the release of all political prisoners, the formation of a transitional government council and a 10-year ban on political candidacy for anyone who had served in government or parliament over the past decade.
Sisi won a second four-year term in April after securing more than 90 percent of the vote in a presidential election that was criticised as being a one-man show with no credible opposition.
At least six candidates were either jailed, prosecuted or forced to pull out of the race.xA0;
Since coming to power after leading the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi in 2013, Sisix2019;s government has presided over a sweeping crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands of dissidents and journalists.
The government has banned unauthorised protests, heavily restricted civil society groups and blocked hundreds of websites.
