Can you trust the polling numbers in the United States in 2020? Pollsters say yes, polling has improved since its failure in 2016 to forecast Donald Trumpx2019;s win. And yet, uncertainties remain.
Looking at the political polling data today, it would seem obvious that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is winning the election.
But the memory of Donald Trumpx2019;s surprise victory in 2016 still haunts forecasters and pollsters four years later. Therex2019;s a level of caution in the wind. Few will venture a prediction.
x201C;If we didnx2019;t have in our memory 2016, we would be near certain that Biden could win,x201D; said Shibley Telhami, a pollster and professor of political science at the University of Maryland.
x201C;Any real objective analysis, including an objective comparison to 2016, would lead you to believe that Trumpx2019;s situation is pretty much hopeless,x201D; Telhami told Al Jazeera.
Averages of high-quality surveys x2013; those done by telephone, not online, and with track records of accuracy x2013; show Biden leading in the three Midwest states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that gave Donald Trump the presidency in 2016.
If everything else remained the same and Biden won those states, he would win the White House. But nothing is ever that simple in politics and Trump is competing aggressively in the Midwest and elsewhere, claiming polls show him leading.
x201C;Wex2019;re at 52 percent, they donx2019;t want to report it,x201D; Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on October 26.

Sir, we do get it out. They will not report itx2019;,x201D; Trump said, purporting to recount conversations with his campaign advisers.
Trump blames the media for failing to report polls showing him ahead. x201C;These people are the most dishonest,x201D; Trump said in Pennsylvania, pointing to media cameras covering his rally and claiming hex2019;s leading in Nevada and x201C;leading bigx201D; in Texas and Ohio, and up four points in Florida.

Obama is drawing VERY small tiny numbers of people. Biden is drawing almost no one. We are drawing tens of thousands of people. Youx2019;ll see that again today. The Great Red Wave is coming!!!

Actually, the public polling shows something else. Biden is leading in Nevada and other battleground states x2013; and is effectively tied with Trump in Florida and Ohio while Trumpx2019;s lead in Texas has narrowed so much that independent analysts are rating it a toss-up.
x201C;We know that Donald Trump is trying to bring a greater turnout among his core,x201D; said Lee Miringoff, director of the Institute for Public Opinion at Marist College, which is polling voters in 2020.
x201C;Put the tag on them x2013; they are men, they donx2019;t have a college education, they live in the Rust Belt and they didnx2019;t vote last time,x201D; Miringoff told Al Jazeera.
x201C;Itx2019;s a gamble because if the turnout is high in other groups x2013; suburban women x2013; even if Trump is successful, he still fails,x201D; said Miringoff, who is comfortable that the polling in 2020 is accurate.
There are two big uncertainties pollsters are grappling with in 2020: the coronavirus pandemic and the massive wave of early voting, which have pollsters guessing at what the electorate will look like on Election Day.
Most of the early voting has tended to favour Biden. And polls show most of the Election Day voting is likely to favour Trump.
x201C;It is a dynamic unlike any we have ever seen,x201D; said Don Levy, director of the Siena College Research Institute, which is producing polls for The New York Times.

x201C;Polling is by definition very uncertain because it is an estimate of an uncertain population, that is, people who turn out to vote,x201D; said Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas.
x201C;I donx2019;t know, and nobody knows what all the characteristics of the voters will be when all the voting is done,x201D; Henson told Al Jazeera.
The truth is that polling in 2016 was mostly accurate, a post-election review by the American Association for Public Opinion Research found. Hillary Clinton did win the popular vote narrowly, as polls had predicted. But she lost where it matters x2013; in the Electoral College.
Hillary Clinton supporters, expecting to see the first woman elected US president, were dejected when results showed Donald Trump the surprise winner in 2016 File: Matt Rourke/AP PhotoWhere polling failed in 2016 was in state-level polls underestimating Trumpx2019;s support in the upper Midwest among white men without college degrees x2013; now a demographic that pollsters are tracking very closely.
Another overlooked factor in 2016 was that most state polls were conducted a week or more before the election and did not pick up the late-breaking swing in undecided voters to Trump. This time around, pollsters see far fewer voters who have yet to make up their minds about Biden or Trump.
x201C;There have been far more polls by people who are good at what they do in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania x2013; the most important three states,x201D; Levy told Al Jazeera.
x201C;If everything stays as it is now, and these polls over the next days show the same and Trump ends up winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, wex2019;ve got a lot of x2018;splaining to do, because right now the averages in those three states are pretty clear,x201D; Levy said.
