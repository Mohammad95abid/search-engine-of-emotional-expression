Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, thexA0;general who ousted Egyptx2019;s first freely elected leader last July, has declaredxA0;his candidacy for a presidential election he isxA0;expected to easily win.xA0;
Wearing military fatigues and speaking in a nationally televised address , Sisi said it was the last time he wouldxA0;wear an army uniform and that x201C;I give up the uniform to defend the nationx201D; and run in the elections, which are expected next month.
x201C;I have spent all my life as a soldier for the sake of the country x2026;xA0;I am telling you that I intend to run for the president of Egypt, and this support from you will give me this honour,x201D; he said. 
Sisi said Egypt was x201C;threatened by terroristsx201D; and spoke of returning the country to dignity. 
x201C;It wasnx2019;t the army or political forces who ousted the last two regimes; it was you the people. My entering the presidency race doesnx2019;t not mean that others shouldnx2019;t,x201D; he said.
The 59-year-old Sisi is widely expected to win the vote, and restore axA0;tradition of presidents from military background that Egypt had for all butxA0;one year since 1952.
He has been the countryx2019;s most powerful figure sincexA0;removing President Mohammed Morsi, and Morsix2019;s once politically dominantxA0;Muslim Brotherhood has since been declared a terrorist group.
Among his supporters, Sisi is wildly popular. Many see himxA0;as the kind of strongman needed to stabilise a country in crisis. But he is reviled by the Islamist opposition as thexA0;mastermind of a coup against a freely elected leader.xA0;
Celebrations and protests 
Following Sisix2019;s announcement, there were protests by supporters of Morsi on the streets of the capital Cairo.xA0;
Magdy Karkar, a senior member of a Brotherhood-led coalition organisingxA0;anti-government protests, said Sisix2019;s candidacy confirms that Morsix2019;sxA0;removal was a coup aimed at wrecking democracy, as Islamists have contended.
x201C;His running will not achieve stability in Egypt. Itx2019;s true he has manyxA0;supporters who love him or even worship him. But on the other hand, there are those who hate General el-Sisi and hold him responsible for the blood that has been shed,x201D; Karkar told the Associated Press news agency.
Watching his speech in a coffee shop in Cairo, however, Sabry Ahmed, in his latexA0;50s, said Sisi has what Egypt needed.
x201C;He is a political man, a military man, and an economics man. HexA0;understands in everything regarding the state,x201D;he said.
x201C;We canx2019;t comparexA0;him to anyone else. The country needs a strong man of his size.x201D;
In the neighborhood where Sisi was born in old Cairo, celebrationsxA0;broke out as soon as he finished his speech. A distant relative, MohammedxA0;Haroun, cheered: x201C;This is the best decision he took in his life.x201D;
Death sentence outrage 
Commenting on Sisix2019;s candidacy, the United States, a majorxA0;source of military aid to Egypt, said it did not support individual candidates or parties in Egyptian elections.























Analyst says Egypt is a dictatorship, not a democracy




x201C;As the election process moves forward we urge the EgyptianxA0;authorities to ensure that the elections are free, fair, and transparent; that all candidates are able to campaign freely,xA0;without fear of harassment or intimidation; and that the views of all the Egyptian people are fully represented,x201D; White HousexA0;National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said inxA0;a statement.
Sisix2019;s decision came amid reports that one person had been killed during protests against Mondayx2019;s court verdict that sentenced more than 500 alleged Muslim Brotherhood supporters to death.xA0;
At least 30 people were wounded in the protests over the ruling that drew criticism from internationalxA0;human rights groups and Western powers.xA0;
The authorities have yet to set a date for the presidentialxA0;election. Leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, who came third in the 2012 election, is so far the only other candidate to have statedxA0;his intention to run. 
General Sedki Sobhi, who holds the post of chief of staff,xA0;is expected to replace Sisi as army chief and defence minister.xA0;
