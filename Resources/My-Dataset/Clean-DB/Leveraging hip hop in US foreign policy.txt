The US government wants to improve its tarnished image abroad by sending out x2018;hip hop envoysx2019; GALLO/GETTY




In April 2010, the US State Department sent a rap group named Chen Lo and The Liberation Family to perform in Damascus, Syria.
Following Chen Lox2019;s performance, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton was asked by CBS News about US diplomacyx2019;s recent embrace of hip hop. x201C;Hip hop is America,x201D; she said, noting that rap and other musical forms could help x201C;rebuild the imagex201D; of the United States. x201C;You know it may be a little bit hopeful, because I canx2019;t point to a change in Syrian policy because Chen Lo and the Liberation Family showed up. But I think we have to use every tool at our disposal.x201D; 
The State Department began using hiphop as a tool in the mid-2000s, when, in the wake of Abu Ghraib and the resurgence of the Taliban, Karen Hughes, then undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, launched an initiative called Rhythm Road. The programme was modelled on the jazz diplomacy initiative of the Cold War era, except that in the x201C;War on Terrorx201D;, hip hop would play the central role of countering x201C;poor perceptionsx201D; of the US.xA0;
In 2005, the State Department began sending x201C;hip hop envoysx201D; x2013; rappers, dancers, DJs x2013; to perform and speak in different parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The tours have since covered the broad arc of the Muslim world, with performances taking place in Senegal and Ivory Coast, across North Africa, the Levant and Middle East, and extending to Mongolia, Pakistan and Indonesia.
The artists stage performances and hold workshops; those hip hop ambassadors who are Muslims talk to local media about being Muslim in the US. The tours aim not only to exhibit the integration of American Muslims, but also, according to planners, to promote democracy and foster dissent.
x201C;You have to bet at the end of the day, people will choose freedom over tyranny if theyx2019;re given a choice,x201D; Clinton observed of the State Departmentx2019;s hip hop programme in Syria x2013; stating that cultural diplomacy is a complex game of x201C;multidimensional chessx201D;.
x201C;Hip hop can be a chess piece?x201D; asked the interviewer. x201C;Absolutely!x201D; responded the secretary of state.
Much has been said about the role of hip hop in the Arab revolts. French media describedxA0;fr the Arab Spring as le printemps des rappeurs x201C;The spring of the rappersx201D;. Time Magazine named Tunisian rapper Hamada Ben Amor aka El General x2013; a rapper who was arrested by Tunisian dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali x2013; as one of the x201C;100 Most Influential People of 2011x201D;, ranking him higher than President Barack Obama.xA0;xA0;
Hip hop revolution
It is true that since protests began in Tunisia in December 2010, rap has provided a soundtrack to the North African revolts. As security forces rampaged in the streets, artists in Tunis, Cairo and Benghazi were writing lyrics and cobbling together protest footage, beats and rhymes, which they then uploaded to proxy servers. These impromptu songs x2013;xA0;such asxA0;El Generalx2019;s Rais Lebled x2013; were then picked up and broadcast by Al Jazeera, and played at gatherings and solidarity marches in London, New York and Washington. 
But the role of music should not be exaggerated: Hip hop did not cause the Arab revolts any more than Twitter or Facebook did. The cross-border spread of popular movements is not a new phenomenon in the Arab world x2013; the uprisings of 1919, which engulfed Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, occurred long before the advent of the internet, social media or rap music.
And the countries in the region with the most vibrant hip hop scenes, Morocco and Algeria, have not seen revolts. Western journalistsx2019; focus on hip hop x2013; like their fixation on Facebook and Twitter x2013; seems partly because, in their eyes, a taste for hip hop among young Muslims is a sign of moderation, modernity, even x201C;an embrace of the USx201D;.




Interviewer: x201C;Hip hop can be a chess piece?x201D;
Hillary Clinton: Absolutely!x201C;




What is absent from these discussions about rap and the breakdown of Arab authoritarianism is the role that states x2013; in the region and beyond x2013; have played in shaping and directing local hip hop cultures. From deposed Tunisian dictator Ben Alix2019;s mobilisation of hip hop culture against Islamism to the embattled Syrian regimex2019;s current support of x201C;pro-stability rappersx201D;, to the US governmentx2019;s growing use of hip hop in public diplomacy, counter-terrorism and democracy promotion, regimes are intervening to promote some sub-styles of hip hop, in an attempt to harness the genre towards various political objectives.
The jazz tours of the Cold War saw the US government sent integrated bands led by Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman to various parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East to counter Soviet propaganda about American racial practices, and to get people in other countries to identify with x201C;the American way of lifex201D;.
The choice of jazz was not simply due to its international appeal. As historian Penny Von Eschen writes in her pioneering book Satchmo Blows Up the World, in the 1950s, the State Department believed that African-American culture could convey x201C;a sense of shared suffering, as well as the conviction that equality could be gained under the American political systemx201D; to people who had suffered European colonialism.
Similar thinking underpins the current x201C;hip hop diplomacyx201D; initiatives. The State Department planners who are calling for x201C;the leveraging of hip hopx201D; in US foreign policy emphasise x201C;the importance of Islam to the roots of hip hop in Americax201D;, and the x201C;painx201D; and x201C;strugglex201D; that the music expresses.
A Brookings report authored by the programmex2019;s architects x2013; titled x201C;Mightier than the Sword: Arts and Culture in the US-Muslim World Relationshipx201D; 2008 x2013; notes that hip hop began as x201C;outsidersx2019; protestx201D; against the US system, and now resonates among marginalised Muslim youth worldwide. From the Parisian banlieues to Palestine to Kyrgyzstan, x201C;hip hop reflects struggle against authorityx201D; and expresses a x201C;painx201D; that transcends language barriers.xA0;
An ironic choice






Rappers whom Muslim youth relate to often disagree with US foreign policy GALLO/GETTY



Moreover, note the authors, hip hopx2019;s pioneers were inner-city Muslims who x201C;carry on an African-American Muslim tradition of protest against authority, most powerfully represented by Malcolm Xx201D;. The report concludes by calling for a x201C;greater exploitation of this natural connector to the Muslim worldx201D;.xA0;xA0;xA0;xA0; 
The choice of hip hop is ironic: The very music blamed for a range of social ills at home x2013; violence, misogyny, consumerism, academic underperformance x2013; is being deployed abroad in the hopes of making the US safer and better-liked. European states have also been disptaching their Muslim hip hop artists to perform in Muslim-majority countries. Long before the fall of the Gaddafi regime, the British Council was organising hip hop workshops in Tripoli, and sponsoring Electric Steps, x201C;Libyax2019;s only hip hop bandx201D;, as a way to promote political reform in that country. 
Rap is also being used in de-radicalisation and counter-terrorism initiatives. American and European terrorism experts have expressed concerns over x201C;anti-American hip hopx201D;, accenting the radicalising influence of this genre. Others have advocated mobilising certain sub-genres of hip hop against what they call x201C;jihadi coolx201D;.xA0;
Warning that Osama bin Ladenx2019;s associate Abu Yahya al-Libi has made al-Qaeda look x201C;coolx201D;, one terrorism expert recommends that the US respond x201C;with one of Americax2019;s coolest exports: hip hopx201D;, specifically with a x201C;subgroupx201D; thereof.
x201C;Muslim hip hop is Muslim poetry set to drum beats,x201D; explains Jeffrey Halverson in an article titled Rap Is Da Bomb for Defeating Abu Yahya. x201C;Add in the emotional parallels between the plight of African-Americans and, for example, impoverished Algerians living in ghettos outside of Paris or Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and the analogy becomes even clearer.x201D;
But itx2019;s unclear how x201C;Muslim hip hopx201D; will exert a moderating or democratising influence: Will a performance by an African-American Muslim group trigger a particular calming x201C;effectx201D;, pushing young Muslim men away from extremist ideas? Nor is it clear what constitutes x201C;Muslim hip hopx201D;: Does the fact that Busta Rhymes is a Sunni Muslim make his music x201C;Islamicx201D;?xA0; xA0;
Moreover, while references to Islam in hip hop are x2013; as these public diplomacy experts note x2013; legion, they are not necessarily political or flattering. In December 2002, Lil Kim appeared on the cover of OneWorld magazine wearing a burqa and a bikini, saying x201C;F*** Afghanistanx201D;.xA0;
50 Centx2019;s track x201C;Ghetto Quranx201D; is about dealing drugs and x201C;snitchinapos;x201D;. Foxy Brown charmed some and infuriated others with her song x201C;Hot Spotx201D;, saying, x201C;MCs wanna eat me but itx2019;s Ramadan.x201D;xA0;
More disturbing was the video x201C;Hardx201D; released in late 2009 by the diva, Rihanna, in which she appears decked out in military garb, heavily armed and straddling a tankx2019;s gun turret in a Middle Eastern war setting. An Arabic tattoo beneath her bronze bra reads, x201C;Freedom Through Christx201D;; on a wall is the Quranic verse: x201C;We belong to God, and to Him we shall returnx201D; x2013; recited to honour the dead, and not an uncommon wall inscription in war-torn Muslim societies. 
The point is that not all Islam-alluding hip hop resonates with Muslim youth. Those hip hop stars x2013; Lupe Fiasco, Mos Def, Rakim x2013; who are beloved among Muslim youth are appreciated because they work their Muslim identity into their art and because they forthrightly criticise US foreign policy.
At the recent BET hip hop Awards, Lupe Fiasco performed his hit x201C;Words I Never Saidx201D;, with a Palestinian flag draped over his mic. x201C;Gaza Strip was getting burned; Obama didnx2019;t say sh**,x201D; he rapped. But neither Lupe nor Mos are likely to be invited on a State Department tour.
For State Department officials, the hip hop initiatives in Muslim-majority states showcase the diversity and integration of post-civil rights America. The multi-hued hip hop acts sent overseas represent a post-racial or post-racist American dream, and exhibit the achievements of the civil rights movement, a uniquely American moment that others can learn from.xA0;xA0;
But itx2019;s unclear how persuasive this racialised imagery is. Muslims do not resent the US for its lack of diversity. Where perceptions are poor, it is because of foreign policy, as well as, increasingly, domestic policies that target Muslims.xA0;
Perhaps the greatest irony of the State Departmentx2019;s efforts to showcase the model integration of US Muslims, and to deploy the moral and symbolic capital of the civil rights movement, is that these tours x2013; as with the jazz tours x2013; are occurring against a backdrop of unfavourable and racialised media images of Quran burnings, anti-mosque rallies and anti-sharia campaigns, as one of the most alarming waves of nativism in recent US history surges northward.
US diplomacyx2019;s embrace of hip hop as a foreign policy tool has sparked a heated debate, among artists and aficionados worldwide, over the purpose of hip hop: whether hip hop is x201C;protest musicx201D; or x201C;party musicx201D;; whether it is the x201C;soundtrack to the strugglex201D; or to American unipolarity; and what it means now that states x2013; not just corporations x2013; have entered the hip hop game.
Hip hop activists have long been concerned about how to protect their music from corporate power, but now that the music is being used in diplomacy and counterterrorism, the conversation is shifting.
The immensely popular x201C;undergroundx201D; British rapper Lowkey Kareem Denis recently articulated the question on many minds: x201C;Hip hop at its best has exposed power, challenged power, it hasnx2019;t served power. When the US government loves the same rappers you love, whose interests are those rappers serving?x201D;
