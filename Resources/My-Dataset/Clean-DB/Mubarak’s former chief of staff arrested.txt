Egyptian state prosecutors have ordered that a former top aide to Hosni Mubarak, the countryx2019;sxA0;ousted president,xA0;be jailed for 15 days pending a corruption investigation.
Zakaria Azmi, Mubarakx2019;s chief of staff for 22 years, was arrested on Thursday after beingxA0;accused of using his position to amass a personal fortune.
Prosecutor Assem el-Gawhari announced Azmix2019;s preliminaryxA0;imprisonment on state television.
Azmi was considered an influential figure within Mubarakx2019;sxA0;ruling National Democratic Party NDPxA0;and is one of many former regime officials whom protesters would like to see prosecuted or at least investigated.
The slow pace of those investigations, andxA0;a lack of arrests, have spurred the protest movement to rally followers back into the streets,xA0;with large demonstrationsxA0;planned for Cairox2019;s Tahrir Square on Friday. 
Protesters are also demanding the complete dissolution of the NDP.
Azmi, an NDP politician from east Cairo, served as Mubarakx2019;s chief of staff from 1989 until the president stepped down on February 11,xA0;following 18 days of upheaval that saw millions of Egyptians take to the streets.
FollowingxA0;Mubarakx2019;sxA0;resignation, state prosecutors arrested three high-ranking officials:xA0;interior minister Habib el-Adly, housing minister Ahmed Maghrabi, and tourism minister Zuheir Garana.
ProtestersxA0;have continued to demand investigations into other powerful figures, including Safwat el-Sherif, speaker of the upper house of parliament, and Fathi Sorour, speaker of the lower house.
