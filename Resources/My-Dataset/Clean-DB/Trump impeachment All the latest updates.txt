US President Donald Trump has been impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives for obstruction of Congress and abuse of power related to his dealings with Ukraine.xA0;
Wednesdayx2019;s landmark votes on impeachment come after a more than two-month inquiry by House Democrats, who accuse the president of pressuring Ukraine toxA0;open an investigation into the presidentx2019;s political rival and former vice president, Joe Biden, who is also a frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic presidential race.
They also charge that the president obstructed their investigation by refusing to comply with subpoenas and directing members of his administration to do the same.xA0;
The votes made Trump only the third president in United States history to be impeached and set the stage for a likely trial in the Republican-led Senate in January.
No president has ever been removed from office via the impeachment process set out in the Constitution, and Republican senators have given little indication of changing that.
As the impeachment aftermath unfolds, here are all the latest updates as of Friday, December 20:
Trump continues to rail against evangelical magazine
Trump on Friday afternoon continued to rail against Christian Today, an evangelical magazine that in an editorial called for his removal.xA0;
x201C;I guess the magazine, x201C;Christianity Today,x201D; is looking for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or those of the socialist/communist bent, to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!x201D; he tweeted, without providing evidence.xA0;

Pelosi invites Trump to deliver State of Union on February 4
Trump has been invited to deliver the State of the Union to a joint session of Congress on February 4, one day after the first caucuses of the 2020 presidential primary season.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to the president on Friday formally inviting him to deliver the address at the US Capitol.
x201C;In the spirit of respecting our Constitution, I invite you to deliver your State of the Union address before a Joint Session of Congress,x201D; Pelosi wrote.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Trump has accepted the date proposed by the speaker.
Pelosi extended the invitation to Trump to make the annual address just two days after the House adopted two articles of impeachment against Trump. A date for the Senate impeachment trial has not yet been set.
Bannon: Trump should have x2018;realx2019; trial with witnesses
While defending Trump, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said the president should want a x201C;realx201D; impeachment trial
x201C;Itx2019;s important for the history x2026; itx2019;s important for the people that voted for President Trump, they believe in him,x201D; Bannon told Fox News.
x201C;He didnx2019;t do anything wrong,x201D; he said, adding that Trump will be x201C;exonerated by the Senate in front of the American people and the worldx201D;.
Senate leaders are currently at an impasse over what a trial will look like.
Pelosi: Power of gavel means Trump is x2018;impeached foreverx2019;
Speaking to the Associated Press, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said no matter what the Senate does, Trump x201C;will be impeached foreverx201D;.
x201C;Hex2019;s impeached forever because he violated our Constitution,x201D; she said.
x201C;If I did nothing else, he saw the power of the gavel there,x201D; Pelosi added. x201C;And it wasnx2019;t me, it was all of our members making their own decision.x201D;
Trump blasts evangelical magazine that called for his removal
Reacting to an editorial in a leading evangelical magazine article, Trump said he has x201C;done more for the Evangelical community, and itx2019;s not even close.x201D;
Christianity Today, founded by the late Billy Graham, published an editorial on Thursday calling for TRumpx2019;s removal from office.xA0;
Trump pushed back on Twitter: x201C;A far left magazine, or very x2018;progressivex2019;, as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasnx2019;t been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would ratherxA0;have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion amp; your guns, than Donald Trump as your President. No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and itx2019;s not even close. Youx2019;ll not get anything from those Dems on stage. I wonx2019;t be reading ET again!x201D;

US leading evangelical magazine: Trump should be removed from office
The leading evangelical magazine in the US called for Trump to get the boot from office, in an editorial published Thursday.
Citing precedent that Christianity Today set when it supported the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton two decades ago, editor Mark Galli wrote that Trump had lost the moral authority to lead the country.xA0;
x201C;We believe the impeachment hearings have made it absolutely clear, in a way the Mueller investigation did not, that President Trump has abused his authority for personal gain and betrayed his constitutional oath,x201D; Galli wrote in the editorial, offering the judgement on the heels of the Housex2019;s vote Wednesday night to impeach the chief executive. 
 White evangelicals were the bedrock of Trumpx2019;s victory in 2016, turning out in force for the Republican. Trump garnered about 80 per cent of the white evangelical vote, according to exit polls. 
 x201C;To the many evangelicals who continue to support Mr Trump in spite of his blackened moral record, we might say this: Remember who you are and whom you serve,x201D; the editorial urged. x201C;Consider what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trumpx2019;s immoral words and behavior in the cause of political expediency.x201D;
Tulsi Gabbard defends voting x2018;presentx2019; on impeachment articlesxA0;
Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who is also vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, defended voting x201C;presentx201D; on Wednesdayx2019;s impeachment articles.xA0;
x201C;So my stance on Wednesday, my vote, was opting out of this zero-sum game mindset and back into one of negotiation and compromise,x201D; she said. x201C;Wex2019;re stuck right now on this terrible scenario where everyone is trying to exact maximum hurt from their opponent for a quote, unquote win. My present vote was not passive; it was an active protest against the terrible fallout of this zero-sum mindset that the two opposing political parties have trapped America in. Therex2019;s no winning here. Everyone is losing.x201D;

Impeachment of Trump voted top 2019 news story in AP poll
The drive by the Democratic-led House of Representatives to impeach Trump was the top news story of 2019, according to The Associated Pressx2019; annual poll.
Trump also figured in the second and third biggest stories of the year: the fallout over his immigration policies and the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether his election campaign coordinated with Russia.
But it was impeachment that was by far the top choice in the AP poll.xA0;

x2018;Most corruptx2019;
In the aftermath of Wednesdayx2019;s impeachment, all seven Democrat presidential candidates at the last 2019 presidential debate said the president must be defeated at the 2020 ballot box. 
 x201C;We need to restore the integrity of the presidency,x201D; said frontrunner Biden, who accused Trump of x201C;dumbing downx201D; the office x201C;beyond what I even thought he would dox201D;.

The House impeachment votes set up a likely January trial in the Republican-led Senate, where the three senators on Thursdayx2019;s debate stage will act as jurors.
x201C;For these senators who are running, itx2019;s significant because theyx2019;re going to become players of the story now, theyx2019;re no longer watching it,x201D;xA0;said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served under former President Barack Obama.
x201C;Ix2019;m sure we will have some commentary, not just about Donald Trump and why he was impeached, but also about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and about process and about the Constitution and about what theyx2019;re going to do because theyx2019;re all going to make statements at a certain point from the Senate floor,x201D; he added.

McConnell blasts impeachment, says Senate ensures stability
The top Senate Republican is set to denounce the x201C;unfairx201D; House impeachment of Trump and reassure Trump and his supporters that x201C;moments like this are why the United States Senate existsx201D;.
Senator Mitch McConnell, in remarks prepared for a Thursday floor speech, accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of being afraid to send x201C;their shoddy work product to the Senatex201D; after she threw uncertainty into the impeachment process by refusing to say when she would send two impeachment articles to the Senate for a trial.
In excerpts of the remarks, McConnell described Trumpx2019;s impeachment as x201C;the most rushed, least thorough, and most unfair impeachment inquiry in modern historyx201D;.xA0;

Putin talks Trump impeachment
Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed a marathon annual end-of-year news conference on Thursday in Moscow.
Among the issues he discussed was Trumpx2019;s impeachment.
x201C;The party that lost the 2016 election is continuing the fight by other means,x201D; he said.
x201C;The impeachment bill still needs to go through the Senate where Republicans, as far as I know, have a majority. Itx2019;s unlikely they will want to remove from power a representative of their party based on what are, in my opinion, completely fabricated reasons,x201D; he added.
x201C;The Democrats accused Trump of a plot with Russia, and then it emerged that there was no kind of plot. It could not be the basis of impeachment x2026; x201C;Then they thought up some kind of pressure on Ukraine.x201D;

Pelosi will not commit to sending articles to Senate
Minutes after the House impeached Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw the process into confusion by refusing to say when or whether she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial.
At a news conference held immediately after the vote, Pelosi said x201C;wex2019;ll see what happensx201D; when asked if she would send the articles to the Senate. She said that House Democrats could not name impeachment managers x2013; House prosecutors who make the case in a Senate trial x2013; until they know more about how the Senate will conduct a trial.
Pelosi made the comments after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected a proposal earlier this week from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to call several witnesses. The Republican-led Senate is expected to acquit Trump.
Asked if she could guarantee she would send the articles, she said: x201C;That would have been our intentionx201D;, but that they will see what the Senate decides.
x201C;We are not having that discussion, we have done what we set out to do,x201D; she said.

Trump keeps veering back to impeachment at rally
Trumpx2019;s campaign rally speech in Michigan on Wednesday night zigged and zagged through a variety of seemingly unrelated topics before he would veer back to address the topic at hand: The landmark vote in the House of Representatives to impeach him.
As the first votes were cast, Trump complained about x201C;the crapx201D; he has had to go through.
Just after the House passed two articles of impeachment against him, Trump said the vote showed the x201C;x2018;deep hatred and disdainx201D; Democrats have for voters.
Later in the rally, Trump read off the vote and noted that three Democrats crossed over to join Republicans in voting against impeachment.
White House says it is confident US Senate will exonerate TrumpxA0;
The White House said it was confident the US Senate would exonerate Trump in a trial after the House voted to impeach him for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.
x201C;Today marks the culmination in the House of one of the most shameful political episodes in the history of our nation. Without receiving a single Republican vote, and without providing any proof of wrongdoing, Democrats pushed illegitimate articles of impeachment against the president through the House of Representatives,x201D; White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
x201C;The president is confident the Senate will restore regular order, fairness, and due process, all of which were ignored in the House proceedings. He is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated,x201D; she said.xA0;
Joe Biden reacts

Adjourned
The House is adjourned, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to speak at a news
conference.
Second article x2013; obstruction of Congress
The House also voted to impeach Trump for Obstruction of Congress.
The 229 to 198 vote fell almost entirely along party lines. All ofxA0;Trumpx2018;s fellow Republicans opposed it, and all but three Democrats supported it.
Trump is impeached
Trump was impeached after the Democratic-led House passed the abuse of power article of impeachment on a largely party-line with a 230-197 vote. The House proceeded with a vote on the second article of impeachment charging Trump with obstruction of Congress.

Pelosi wielded the gavel as the House of Representatives voted on the first of two articles of impeachment against Trump House TV/ReutersxA0;

First article x2013; abuse of power
House began voting on the first of two articles of impeachment against Trump.xA0;The first vote, scheduled to last 15 minutes, was on abuse of power. Once that concluded, the House held a five-minute vote on obstruction of Congress.xA0;
As voting continued, supporters of impeachment crossed the 216-vote threshold needed to secure a majority in the House.
Trump takes stage
As the House began voting on impeachment, Trump took the stage at a rally in Michigan.xA0;
x201C;By the way, it doesnx2019;t really feel like wex2019;re being impeached,x201D; Trump said as he opened a campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan.xA0;
x201C;Tonight the House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots ofxA0;tens of millions of patriotic Americans,x201D; he told the raucousxA0;crowd. 
Debate ends
The day-long debate ahead of the landmark vote to impeach Trump came to a close and voting began.
Michigan rallyxA0;
Vice President Mike Pence addressed a large campaign rally in Michigan, where Trump was expected to make an appearance.xA0;
xA0;x201C;Theyx2019;re trying to run down this president because they canx2019;t run against our record,x201D; Pence said. x201C;They know they canx2019;t stop you from giving President Donald Trump four more years in the White House.x201D;
But the crowd was growing restless as his appearance was delayed by more than 45 minutes.xA0;
x201C;We want Trump,x201D; the audience chanted.
The x201C;Merry Christmasx201D; rally held in the Kellogg Arena inxA0;Battle Creek, included two decorated Christmas trees set on the stage topped with Trumpx2019;s signature red heads bearing the x201C;Keep America Greatx201D; slogan.
Gaveled
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler accused Republican legislator Louie Gohmert of spouting Russian propaganda, sparking a heated clash on the House floor.
Gohmert said the impeachment inquiry aimed to x201C;stop the investigation of the US Department of Justice and Ukraine into the corruption of Ukraine interference into the US election in 2016.x201D;
Nadler, returning to the podium after Gohmert concluded his speech, came back to respond.
x201C;I am deeply concerned that any member of the House would spout Russian propaganda on the floor of the House,x201D; Nadler said.
Gohmert responded by yelling and jabbing his finger at Nadler, but his reaction was drowned out by Representative Diana DeGette, who banged the gavel and called for order.
x2018;Vendettax2019;
Highlighting the Republican accusations that the Democratic-led Trump impeachment proceedings are politically motivated, veteran Republican Steve Scalise said: x201C;Letx2019;s talk about what this is really about. This is about a political vendetta.x201D;
x201C;This isnx2019;t about some crime that he committed. Itx2019;s about fear that the might get re-elected,x201D;xA0;Scalise said.
Number two House Democrat Steny HoyerxA0;called on Republicans to show political courage and recognise the evidence against Trump.
x201C;Damning evidence of the presidentx2019;s high crimes has emerged. Nevertheless, Republicans have continued to defend the president,x201D; Hoyer said.
x201C;Party loyalty must have its limits. As evidence mounts daily, itx2019;s become increasingly clear that the limits of partisanship have been reached.x201D;
Contentious back-and-forth
As the vote neared, the bitterly divided Democratic and Republican legislators continued to trade accusations.
Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren worked as a Judiciary Committee staffer on the impeachment investigation of President Richard Nixon and as a member for the impeachment investigations of President Bill Clinton and Trump. She was one of many legislators who brought up the past.
x201C;George Washington would be astonished since he warned against the insidious wiles of foreign influence,x201D;xA0; she said.

Republican Representative Chris Stewart, one of Trumpx2019;s most emphatic defenders during the impeachment investigation, said Democrats despise Trump and his supporters.
x201C;This day is about one thing and one thing only. They hate this president. They hate those of us who voted for him. They think we are stupid.x201D;
He warned x201C;gleefulx201D; Democrats of a dangerous precedent. x201C;If you set this bar as being impeachable, every president in our future will be impeached,x201D; Stewart said.
Trump rally
Thousands of Trump supporters braved the bitter Midwest cold queuing for hours, some overnight, to attend a large rally in Battle Creek, Michigan.xA0;
Moment of silence
Republican Congressman Bill Johnson,xA0;accusing Democrats of trying to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election by impeaching Trump, asked for a moment of silence to remember the x201C;63 million Americansx201D; who voted for Trump and have been forgotten.
All the Republicans in the House chamber stood up, Democrats stayed glued to their seats.
Partisan differences on full display
As the hours-long debate surged on, Republicans stoutly defended Trump on the House floor and Democrats pushed back.
x201C;The matter before the House today is based solely on a fundamental hatred of our president. Itx2019;s a sham, a witch-hunt x2013; and itx2019;s tantamount to a coup against the duly elected president of the United States,x201D;xA0;Republican Representative Mike Rogers said.
Adam Schiff, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, shot back: x201C;Many of my colleagues appear to have made their choice x2013; to protect the president, to enable him to be above the law, to empower this president to cheat again, as long as it is in the service of their party and their power.x201D;
Charged rally
Trump headed to a rally in the battleground swing state of Michigan for what was expected to be a highly charged event.
The White House said the president would be busy on Wednesday, working, rather than focused on the proceedings in the House x2013; in a move critics slammed as an attempt to brush off the significance of the dayx2019;s events.

The president has said the impeachment would bolster Republicans and Trumpx2019;s campaign has experienced a surge in contributions and volunteers during the proceedings.
Allies nonetheless acknowledge that Trump has been angry over the stain the episode will leave on his legacy.
x2018;Trump treated less fairly than Jesusx2019;
A Republican legislator from Georgia said Jesus was x201C;afforded more rightsx201D; ahead of his crucifixion than Trump before the impeachment vote.
x201C;When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers,x201D; Congressman Barry Loudermilk said from the House floor.
x201C;During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than Democrats have afforded this president in this process,x201D; the legislator added.

Loudermilk, a conservative, represents a solidly Republican district in the Atlanta area. A Baptist, he wrote the book, And Then They Prayed, featuring stories of American figures famous in history at prayer.
Meanwhile, Republican Representative Mike Kelly compared the impeachment with the Japanese attack on the US naval base at Hawaiix2019;s Pearl Harbor in 1941, calling the House proceedings another x201C;date that will live in infamyx201D;, similar to the words Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt used to describe the raid that led to the USx2019;s entry into the second world war.
Trump himself has compared the drive to impeach him with the Salem Witch trials. During the infamous 17th century trials, 20 people suspected of witchcraft were killed in Massachusetts.
Deep divide
Underscoring the deep divide in Congress over Trumpx2019;s conduct during his presidency,xA0;Republicans defended the presidentxA0;in a series of speeches on the House floor and accused Democrats of seeking to topple him from power using an unfair and rigged process to nullify the results of the 2016 election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.
x201C;To Democrats, itx2019;s politics, not facts, that matter,x201D; Republican Doug Collins said.
x201C;Today is going to be a lot of things. What it is not, is fair,x201D; Collins said.

He has also refused to heed subpoenas for documents.

Duelling strategies
The rhetoric heard during the hearings of the impeachment inquiry was again on display during Wednesdayx2019;s debate.
Many Democrats pointed to the actions of Trump that led to the impeachment inquiry and his refusal to participate in the investigation. They also urged their colleagues to uphold their oath to the constitution.
x201C;In 2019, President Trump sought foreign interference when he needed a favour from Ukraine,x201D; said Democrat Steve Cohen.
x201C;President Trump attacked in his continuing threat to our system of free and fair elections. I took an oath. I urge my colleagues to abide by that oath and stand up to President Trumpx2019;s abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,x201D; Cohen added.
Republicans, meanwhile, focused on attacking the impeachment inquiry process itself, saying Trump was blocked from having due process.
x201C;This impeachment is based purely on partisan motives,x201D; Republican Ross Spano on the House floor.

House impeachment votes: What to watch for

Spoiler alert x2013; Trump is headed for a near-certain impeachment
Any defections? x2013; Expect most Democrats to vote for impeachment and all Republicans to vote against it. One freshman Democrat, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, indicated he would oppose impeachment, then switch parties to become a Republican. Earlier this year, Justin Amash left the Republican party when he favoured impeachment. He is expected to vote yes to impeach. And one new Democratic congressman, Jared Golden of Maine, said he would vote to impeach on abuse of power but not obstruction.
Will Wednesdayx2019;s debate change American minds? x2013; That is still unclear. According to the latest polling, the Democratsx2019; more than two months of investigation, including hours of public hearings did little to sway Republican voters to support impeachment.xA0;
What about Trump? x2013; The US president will likely continue tweeting throughout Wednesdayx2019;s vote. On Tuesday, he sent a scathing letter to House Democratic leaders, accusing them of x201C;bring pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish, personal political gainx201D;.xA0;
Next stop: Senate x2013; We may see more jabs traded in the Senate as leaders try to agree on next steps with a Senate trial.

Refresher: What is impeachment?
The founders of the US included impeachment in the US Constitution as an option for removal of presidents by Congress. Delegates to the constitutional convention of 1787 in Philadelphia agreed that presidents could be removed if found guilty by Congress of x201C;treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanoursx201D;.
The sole authority under the Constitution to bring articles of impeachment is vested in the House of Representatives where proceedings can begin in the Judiciary Committee. If the House approves articles of impeachment, or x201C;impeachesx201D; a president, he or she would then be subject to trial in the US Senate.xA0;

Trump sends blistering letter to Pelosi
In a letter addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, Trump accused Democrats of pursuing an x201C;illegal, partisan attempted coupx201D; and declaring war on American democracy.
The rambling, six-page letter on White House letterhead largely restated the presidentx2019;s objections to the impeachment inquiry but did so in accusatory and sometimes spiteful language that attacked Pelosi, congressional Democrats, Trump x2018;s political rival Joe Biden and institutions such as the FBI.
x201C;This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth,x201D; Trumpx2019;s letter stated.
x201C;By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy,x201D; Trump wrote.
x201C;You view democracy as your enemy!x201D; he added. 
Read the full letter here.xA0;
Duelling speeches in Senate over impeachment next steps
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday brushed aside a Democratic request to call four current and former White House officials as witnesses in a Senate impeachment trial expected next month, sending another clear signal that he expects senators not to remove Trump from office.
Speaking from the Senate floor, McConnell said he would not allow a x201C;fishing expeditionx201D; after a x201C;slapdashx201D; House impeachment process.
In his speech from the Senate floor, however, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a trial without witnesses would be a x201C;shamx201D; and suggested Trumpx2019;s fellow Republicans favoured a cover-up.
Sparring over rules
At the Capitol, Democrats and Republicans sparred over the rules of debate on Tuesday with legislators arguing over the parameters for the debate.
x201C;Itx2019;s unfortunate that we have to be here today, but the actions of the president of the United States make that necessary,x201D; said Chairman Jim McGovern. x201C;The evidence is as clear as it is overwhelming.x2033;

He said the president x201C;jeopardised our national security. and he undermined our democracyx201D; and added that x201C;every day we let President Trump act like the law doesnx2019;t apply to him, we move a little closerx201D; to rule by dictators.
Republicans disagreed, firmly.
The top committee Republican, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, said the split view among Americans over impeachment should be reason enough not to proceed with the rare action. x201C;When half of Americans are telling you what you are doing is wrong, you should listen,x201D; he said.
Senate trial: Democrats want four witnesses
Top Democrat in the Senate Chuck Schumer said he wants the trial to consider documents and hear testimony from four witnesses: Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Mulvaney aide Robert Blair and budget official Michael Duffey. Schumer has argued that such testimony could sway Republicans in favour of removing Trump.

Trump has refused to cooperate with the House impeachment process and ordered current and former officials like those mentioned by Schumer not to testify or provide documents.
McConnell took aim at Schumer and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee that spearheaded the impeachment inquiry launched in September.
Giuliani: Trump x2018;relied onx2019; on his claims
Rudy Giuliani, Trumpx2019;s personal lawyer, said in an interview with the New York Times published on Tuesday that he provided the president with information that the US ambassador to Ukraine was impeding investigations that could benefit Trump politically. Within weeks, she was recalled from her post.
In the interview, Giuliani portrayed himself as directly involved in the effort to remove Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, and he provided details indicating Trumpx2019;s knowledge of that effort.
Giuliani said he passed along information to Trump x201C;a couple of timesx201D; about how Yovanovitch had frustrated efforts that could help Trump, including efforts to have Ukraine investigate political rival, Joe Biden.
