x201C;We oppose any unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,x201D; Bush said in Washington when asked about a proposed 20 March referendum in Taiwan.xA0; 
xA0;
x201C;And the comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo, which we oppose,x201D; the US president added, seated along with visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.

Taiwan argument
xA0;xA0; 
Chen has argued that his proposed referendum falls short of any moves to change the status quo on sovereignty between his nationalist island and the mainland, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province. 
xA0;xA0; 
But Bushx2019;s strong words make it clear that Washington does not agree. 
xA0;xA0; 
The US, while a strong supporter of democratic Taiwan, which it is bound by law to defend, grants diplomatic recognition only to Beijing under the one-China policy.xA0;xA0;xA0;
xA0;
Earlier, ChinaxA0;warned Taiwan that itxA0;could x201C;absolutely not acceptx201D; any moves towards independence.


Premier Wen Jiabao used White House talks on Tuesday with President George Bush to deliverxA0;the stark warning. 
HexA0;emphasised Chinax2019;s view that the referendum was part of a separatist agenda in Taiwan.xA0;

x201C;The Chinese government respects the desire of people in Taiwan for democracy,x201D; Wen said. 
x201C;But we must point out that the attempts of Taiwan authorities, headed by Chen Shui-bian, are only using democracy as an excuse and an attempt to resort to a defensive referendum to split Taiwan away from China.

x201C;Such separatist activities are what the Chinese side can absolutely not accept and tolerate.x201D; 
But Wen said as long as a x201C;glimmer of hopex201D; remained, China would try to settle the dispute peacefully. 
x201C;Stability can only be maintained through unswerving opposition and firm opposition to pro-independence activities,x201D; he said. 
x201C;We very much appreciate the position adopted by President Bush toward the latest moves and developments in Taiwan.x201D;xA0;Wen said.
Chen, leader of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party DPP, said onxA0;Sunday thatxA0;the x201C;anti-missile, anti-warx201D; referendum was aimed at asking China to dismantle hundreds of ballistic missiles targeting the island.
