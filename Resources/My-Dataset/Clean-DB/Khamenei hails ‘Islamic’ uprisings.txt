Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iranx2019;sxA0;supreme leader has called the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia an x201C;Islamic liberation movementx201D;.
In his address, during Friday prayers at Tehran University in Iranx2019;s capital, he said that people are witnessing the reverberations of Iranx2019;s 1979 Islamic revolution.
x201C;The awakening of the Islamic Egyptian people is an Islamic liberation movement and I, in the name of the Iranian government, salute the Egyptian people and the Tunisian people,x201D;he said.
Khamenei has urged Egyptx2019;s protesters to follow in the footsteps of the Iranian revolution which toppled a pro-US leader and installed an Islamic Republic,xA0;calling on Egyptians to unite around religion.
He saidxA0;events in Tunisia and Egypt, were a sign of x201C;Islamic awarenessx201D; in the region and that these movements will spell an x201C;irreparable defeatx201D; for the United States.

Khamenei added that the Egyptx2019;s embattled president, Hosni Mubarak, is a x201C;servantx201D; of Israel and the United States.
x201C;For 30 years this country Egypt has been in the hands of someone who is not seeking freedom and is the enemy of those seeking freedom.
x201C;Not only he is not anti-Zionist, but he is the companion, colleague, confidant and servant of Zionists. It is a fact that Hosni Mubarakx2019;s servitude to America has been unable to take Egypt one step towards prosperity.x201D;
The spiritual leaderx2019;s remarks were received by cheering crowds of worshippers who, raising their hands, chanted x201C;Death to America! Death to Israel!x201D;
The sermon marked the first time in seven months that the leader has addressed the weekly Friday prayers, and came as protesters were massing in Egypt to participate in x201C;departure dayx201D; demonstrations to force Mubarak to quit.
x201C;Todayx2019;s events in North Africa, Egypt and Tunisia and some other countries have different meanings for us,x201D; Khamenei said.
x201C;This is what was always talked about as the occurrence of Islamic awakening at the time of the Islamic revolution of the great Iranian nation and is showing itself today.x201D;
Top Iranian officials have supported the protests in Egypt and have warned Tehranx2019;s arch-foe Washington against x201C;interferingx201D; in what they say is a movement of the people.
Khamenei said that Israel was the country most concerned about the Arab revolts.
x201C;Today more than the fleeing Tunisian and Egyptian officials, Israelis and the Zionist enemies are the most worried about these events as they know if Egypt stops being their ally and take its rightful place, it would be a great event in the region,x201D; he said.
Dorsa Jabbari, Al Jazeerax2019;s correspondent in Tehran, said Khamenei x201C;is asking them to follow through what he is calling a real earthquake in the regionx201D;.
The Iranian people are supporting the uprising in Egypt as x201C;they believe that it has been long time in the making and it is about time that the Egyptian people put an end to the dictatorship in their countryx201D;, our correspondent said.
x201C;They the Iranians see the events as extremely significant as they feel that it is the opportunity to change the religious field in the region.x201D;xA0;
