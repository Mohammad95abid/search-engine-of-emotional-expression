United States President Donald Trump revealed in the early hours of October 2 that he had tested positive for COVID-19. White House officials and doctors have refused to disclose when the president last tested negative for the coronavirus before the positive test.
It remains unclear how and where Trump may have contracted the virus and how long he had symptoms.
The president was admitted to Walter Reed National Medical Center on the evening of October 2 after White House physician Dr Sean Conley and chief of staff Mark Meadows became alarmed by his condition. Conley said the president had a fever from Thursday into Friday.
President Trump was forced to suspend his re-election campaign travel and rallies during his three-night stay at the Walter Reed hospital before returning to the White House on October 5.
Dr Conley and the presidentx2019;s medical team have given daily briefings or issued statements to the news media describing Trumpx2019;s COVID-19 symptoms as relatively mild. They have said the president is being treated with remdesivir, an antiviral medication, and dexamethasone, a powerful anti-inflammatory steroid that is typically used on patients with serious COVID-19 symptoms.
Trump was initially given a dose of the experimental antibody cocktail Regeneron before leaving the White House. The president required supplemental oxygen on two occasions on October 2 and 3, the doctors said.
Doctors have declined to provide specifics on any damage or pneumonia in the presidentx2019;s lungs.
More than two dozen of Trumpx2019;s close aides, political allies and White House staff have now tested positive for COVID-19 in the outbreak.
Days seven to 10 of the disease would be critical in how the disease progresses, Dr Conley had said.
Here is a timeline of events:
October 9, 20:20 ET x2013; Trump says hex2019;s feeling x2018;strongx2019;
In a taped appearance on Fox News television, President Donald Trump said he is feeling x201C;strongx201D; after his bout with COVID-19.
The president again credited an infusion of the experimental Regeneron antibody cocktail for his rapid recovery from the deadly virus.
When asked about his symptoms when he first became sick, Trump was vague, saying he x201C;didnx2019;t feel strong x2026;xA0;I didnx2019;t feel how the president of the United States should feel.x201D;
Trump acknowledged that lung scans showed hexA0;x201C;initially had some congestion in therex201D; which he said was one reason x201C;why they wanted me to stayx201D; in the hospital longer.
Trump said he thinks catching the virus x201C;early was a big factorx201D;. He said he is being tested regularly to assess whether he still has the virus.
October 8, 19:00 ET x2013; Trump clear to return to campaign as soon as Saturday: White House physician
President Trumpx2019;s physician Dr. Sean Conley released a statement through the White House communications office saying Trump has continued to x201C;respond extremely well to treatment, without evidence on examination of adverse therapeutic effects.x201D;
x201C;Saturday will be Day 10 since Thursdayx2019;s diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the presidentx2019;s safe return to public engagements at that time.x201D;
Trump returned to work in the Oval Office for a second consecutive day.

October 7, 13:15 ET x2013; White House physician says Trump feels x2018;great!x2019;
Trumpx2019;s physician Dr Sean Conley said in a statement released by the White House communications office that the president has been x201C;fever-free for more than four days, symptom-free for over 24 hours, and has not needed nor received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalizationx201D;. Blood tests show Trump has COVID-19 antibodies, indicating he has developed an immune response to the virus. x201C;The president this morning says, x2018;I feel great!x2019;,x201D; Conley said.
October 6, 21:18 ET x2013; White House aides worry about Trumpx2019;s x2018;cocktail of drugsx2019; amid tweet storm; Trump was not tested daily prior to Friday: Report
Some White House staff members wondered whether President Trumpx2019;s storm of more than 40 tweets x2013; including one cancelling talks on virus relief spending legislation x2013; was spurred by a cocktail of drugs he has been taking, the New York Times newspaper reported.
Trump was to have received a fifth and final dose of remdesivir, an antiviral drug, on Tuesday and had been taking dexamethasone, an anti-inflammation steroid that can cause euphoria and bursts of false energy.
White House officials conceded that prior to Trump testing positive for COVID-19 there had been a false impression created that the president was getting tested daily and a reliance on testing as if it were a curative measure as opposed to a diagnostic, the newspaper reported.
The president was not tested every day, according to two people familiar with the practices, according to the report.
October 6, 12:50 ET x2013; White House says doctors met with Trump and the president reports no COVID-19 symptoms
Dr Sean Conley, Trumpx2019;s physician, said the president x201C;reports no symptomsx201D; of COVID-19 and that his vital signs are stable.
x201C;Overall, he continues to do extremely well,x201D; Dr Conley said in a statement.
Dr Conley and the White House refused to clarify what the x201C;expected findingsx201D; were when asked about Trumpx2019;s chest x-rays at Walter Reed over the weekend, according to news reports.

x201C;Over the past 24 hours, the president has continued to improve. Hex2019;s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria.

x201C;Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations, and most importantly his clinical status, support the presidentx2019;s safe return home where hex2019;ll be surrounded by world-class medical care,x201D; Dr Conley said.

x201C;Yesterday, we talked about that, the several little temporary drops in his oxygen, and we had discussed that as a team and elected to start it early in case that persisted or worsened. The potential risks and side effects, we all discussed. We looked at the data and decided that wex2019;d rather push ahead on it than hold and risk the opposite,x201D; Conley said.
Conley declined to say whether Trump had any pneumonia or inflammation in the lungs.
Trump had used oxygen in x201C;two episodesx201D; and x201C;recovered immediatelyx201D;, Conley said.

Dr Sean Conley tells media at Walter Reed the president had run a high fever on October 2 and had been given supplemental oxygen after his blood saturation levels dropped.
In response to the low-oxygen episodes, Conley said the president was being treated with dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid that outside experts said is more often used in advanced cases of COVID-19 and not recommended for early treatment.
Asked if Trump had signs of lung damage, Conley said, x201C;therex2019;s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concernx201D;.
x201C;The fact of the matter is, is that hex2019;s doing really well. He is responding. As the team said, if everything continues to go well, wex2019;re going to start discharge planning back to the White House,x201D; Conley said.

x201C;Ix2019;ll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow,x201D; Trump said.
The Wall Street Journal, citing White House protocols, said the deep nasal test is only performed after a rapid test has indicated a positive reading, suggesting the president had already received a positive COVID-19 result.
Trump did not disclose a first positive test on the air. A second test later that night confirmed the result.
Earlier in the day, Trump had participated in a round-table discussion and fundraising event with about 200 supporters at his Bedminister, New Jersey, golf club.
