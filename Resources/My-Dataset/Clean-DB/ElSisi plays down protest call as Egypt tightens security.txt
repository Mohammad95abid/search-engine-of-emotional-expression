Egyptx2019;s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has played down a call for protests against his rule, saying there were x201C;no reasons for concernx201D; even as the army and the police tightened security in the capital, Cairo, and other major cities.
The dismissal on Friday came as rights groups said nearly 2,000 people have so far been arrested in a broad crackdown following last weekx2019;s small but rare demonstrations against el-Sisi, who took power in a 2013 coup.
x201C;There are no reasons for concern. Egypt is a strong country thanks to Egyptians,x201D; the president told reporters with a smile, shortly after his return from the United Nations General Assembly UNGA in New York.
In Cairo, security forces closed off entrances to Tahrir Square, the hub of the 2011 uprising that toppled former leader Hosni Mubarak. There was a heavy police presence around the square and at some junctions in the city centre.
Egyptx2019;s Ministry of Interior, in a brief statement on Thursday, warned it would x201C;confront any attempt to destabilise social peace in a firm and decisive wayx201D;. 
Last weekx2019;s protests were in response to a call for action from Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian businessman who accused el-Sisi of wasting public funds on vanity projects despite widespread poverty. The former military contractor, who lives in self-imposed exile in Spain, has called for a x201C;million-man marchx201D; and a x201C;peoplex2019;s revolutionx201D; to topple el-Sisi.

In a new video posted on Thursday night, Ali urged protesters not to clash with security forces and said Tahrir Square must not be the focus of the x201C;Friday of Salvationx201D; protests. x201C;All the squares in Egypt are Tahrir Squares,x201D; he said.
El-Sisi, who came to power after leading the military overthrow of then-President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, has rejected Alix2019;s allegations. He has overseen a broad crackdown on dissent that has extended to liberal as well as Islamist groups and hasxA0;effectively banned protests.
Morsi, the countryx2019;s first democratically-elected president, died in June. He had been in custody since he was deposed as the president.
Human Rights Watch said on Friday that nearly 2,000 people had been arrested over the past week, in what could be the biggest crackdown since 2013.
x201C;Lawyers for detainees have posted on their social media pages several accounts of security forces arbitrarily arresting many people merely for being in the x2018;wrong place at the wrong timex2019; or possessing critical content on their phones,x201D; the rights group said.xA0;xA0; 
In the first official acknowledgement of the protests, the attorney generalx2019;s office said x201C;not more than 1,000 protestersx201D; had been questioned by prosecutors. Detainees included a Dutch national and a Palestinian belonging to the Islamic Jihad group, they said.
It said prosecutors had orders to x201C;inspect the social media accounts and pages of those detainedx201D;.
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights said 96 minors were among the 1,915 people who have been arrested between last weekend and early on Wednesday. 
Eight human rights groups issued a statement demanding the immediate release of political activists and the lifting of restrictions on freedom of expression.
x201C;The protests also are a reaction to the presidentx2019;s accumulated policies since his assumption of office, which have achieved neither political nor economic stability,x201D; the statement read.
Meanwhile, state-run local media have launched a campaign to discredit protesters as traitors who seek to instigate chaos. 
The presidentx2019;s backers have also called for a counterdemonstration with pro-Sisi television ONE telling supporters to gather at the Hisham Barakat Square in Cairo x201C;to show them the love Egyptians have for their country and their leaderx201D;.
