Al Jazeerax2019;s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara envisions a face-to-face session between Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and his former boss, the imprisoned Mohamed Morsi.
Morsi: What the hell are you doing here?
Sisi: I came to see you my old friend. xA0;
Morsi: Yeah, right! Still wearing that idiotic smug on your face.
Sisi: Tahya Masr Long live Egyptx2026; Actually, therex2019;s a reason for my visit.
Morsi: Whatever it is, you should know I make no deals with criminals and certainly wonx2019;t make political deals when I and 40,000 like me are in jail.
Sisi: Oh no, no deal. Only cheer x2013; Tahya Masr.
Morsi: So you want to boast. I realise itx2019;s been a year sincex2026;

Legitimacy
Sisi: Since I was elected president by double your percentage when electedx2026; Well, yes, that did cross my mind.
Morsi: Since another nightmare has started. How dare you compare our elections. You stole yours, I won mine. Youx2019;re in the 90-plus percentage of votes for dictators who covet public will. I am a 50-plus majority president. Youx2019;re like Bashar al-Assad; I am like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Sisi: I was elected legitimately, and I didnx2019;t mess it all up as you did. Arrogant SOD. SOB is not used in Egypt, rather x201C;Son of the dirty-onex201D;.
Morsi: Legitimately?! Donx2019;t use big words you donx2019;t understand. Youx2019;ve orchestrated a military coup and rode it to the top.
Sisi: You also came on the back of a coup dx2019;etat! It was we in the military that removed Mubarak, and donx2019;t you forget it! And not because of pressure, but because we were sick and tired of his succession plans for Gamal Mubarak.
Morsi: You had no choice, the street was boiling.
Sisi: You donx2019;t really think the kids in Tahrir change regimes, do you? Youx2019;re not that naive, are you! Not after all that happened to you?
Morsi: Itx2019;s the revolution x2013; the peoplesx2019; revolution that changed the regime and changed Egypt forever. The people will never forget or forgive what youx2019;ve done.
Sisi: No, they wonx2019;t; they will thank me for it. Tahya Masr.
Morsi: Your counter-revolution will prove no more than a short setback in our history. Nothing can beat an idea whose time has come.
Sisi: Counter-revolution! Thatx2019;s pretty pathetic coming from the Muslim Brotherhood. The June 2013 upheaval against your presidency was far greater than your January 2011 demonstrations against Hosni Mubarak.
Morsi: Thatx2019;s your recollection. Really. Either youx2019;re lying or you believe your own lies.
Sisi: They begged me to run for president after I saved the country from you and your evil organisation. You revealed your true colours; youx2019;re no Brotherhood, youx2019;re evil-hood.
Morsi: You eliminated the chances for anyone else to run, you couldnx2019;t even compete with your former boss, Sami Anan. Your attack dogs delegitimised and even demonised everyone.
Sisi: Whatever makes you sleep better at night x2026; in this cellx2026; chuckle
Morsi: This tiny cell honours me; you dishonour the presidential palace. If you were a man you would come in here, why talk to me from behind bars. Scoundrel. Donx2019;t worry, I wonx2019;t rip your eyes outx2026; chuckle
Revolution
Sisi: Oh, so now youx2019;re challenging me for a fight. Really.xA0;I just canx2019;t stand the odour of your hypocrisy and humiliation, Mr Revolutionary. xA0;
Morsi: I certainly am, a revolutionary. But what are you? An empty man; a conniving little man.
Sisi: I shall ignore that. Youx2019;re a desperate man whox2019;s about to die.
Morsi: Happy to die for my ideals. Are you happy living without any?
Sisi: Since when have you Islamists stood for revolutions? Isnx2019;t Islam against revolution; arenx2019;t you for slow incremental Dax2019;wa and reform? Why donx2019;t you admit that you got hyper-excited and acted immaturely. You hurried in the footsteps of the agitated youth.
Morsi: We couldnx2019;t stand in the righteous path of justice. We couldnx2019;t stand idle while our people, our sons and daughters were lynched by your people in the military and security.
Sisi: The military did us all a favour, a great favour. They saved Egypt from you and Mubarak before you. Do you really think Egyptians want a repeat of Iran on the Nile?
Morsi: Itx2019;s the peoplex2019;s revolution and itx2019;s a just revolution. The people spoke. And we won fair and square. You, on the other hand, you manipulated the system, created food and energy shortages, and you created insecurity and chaos, and you incited people in order to cheat your way to power.xA0;
Sisi: That wasnx2019;t a revolution. There was neither leadership nor ideology; only agitation and empty slogans about freedom and justice.
Morsi: These were not empty words; they were the true representation of peoplesx2019; aspirations. Why should our people live in fear and misery?
Sisi: Itx2019;s chaos and disorder. Have you forgotten our long held Arab/Islamic wisdom: x201C;Better one hundred years of tyranny than one day of chaos.x201D; Youx2019;re responsible for the chaos, confusion and unreasonable expectations.
Morsi: Egyptians prefer our tolerant Islamic ways to your fascist tactics.
Sisi: Egyptians are a diverse and open people; they rejected your chaos and then rejected your Islamic tyranny. What tolerance!?
Morsi: Itx2019;s amazing how you distort the facts while preserving that idiotic smile of yours. Wex2019;ve won the vote x2013; the parliamentary vote, the constitutional vote, and the presidential vote. And you call that tyranny?
Responsibility
Sisi: Here we go again! You live in la la land. What selective memory! People turned on you and your brand of authoritarian Islamism. Thanks to you x2013; and you only x2013; the revolution failed and I am president today. xA0;I came to thank you all. Tahya Masr.
Morsi: No, itx2019;s through your illegitimate and bloody coup that you became president. Why canx2019;t you admit that, at least to me!
Sisi: Look, seriously, no one would have thought of electing a president from the military if it werenx2019;t for your blindness, stubbornness and overreach.
Morsi: We admit with humility that we made mistakes and that we could have done better on a number of fronts. But all of that could have been reversed through the ballot box. Look at Turkey. Turks said no to Erdoganx2019;s wish for absolute majority, without a single shot being fired.
Sisi: Your arrogant friend Erdogan did not try to swallow the entire country after one brief electoral victory as you did. This was his third or fourth election. Youx2019;ve not only made mistakes, youx2019;ve committed political suicide.xA0;
Morsi: I decreed extra emergency powers because the revolution was under threat. I wanted to protect the revolution from you people. It was supposed to be temporary until we passed the tough times. I donx2019;t know why I am explaining this to you, Mr Coup dx2019;Etat.
Sisi: You didnx2019;t seek to defend the revolution; you wanted to preserve your power at any price. And you ended up destroying both the revolution and the Brotherhood.
Morsi: You and your military gang have long predicted our demise, but we always rebounded despite the killings, the arrests and the torture.
Sisi: The joke on the street is that Egyptian presidents have all tried x2013; Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak x2013; theyx2019;ve all tried to destroy the Muslim Brotherhood, but only Morsi succeeded chuckle. Tahya Masr.
Morsi: I and my fellow Brothers succeeded where all others failed. I became the first democratically elected president of Egypt.
Sisi: Nonsense. You simply turned on your partners that made it possible for you to grab power x2013; just as Ayatollah Khomeini did in 1979.xA0;
Morsi: We are nothing like Khomeini. We embraced the democratic process.
Sisi: You were better organised and more experienced than the others and took advantage of that in the ballot box. You left them behind. xA0;
Morsi: We were partners. And remain so.
Sisi: You abandoned them from the beginning. You looked the other way when we killed so many of them at the end of 2011. Remember the Mohammad Mahmoud street killings, snipers shooting protesters in the eyes. xA0;
Morsi: So you admit all of thatx2026;
Sisi: We did what we had to do. Wex2019;re no hypocrites like you. You, on the other hand, you didnx2019;t have the will or the political mindset to cooperate and coordinate with your partners. Thatx2019;s why you ended up alone.
Morsi: We were open and tolerant, we extended a hand to the opposition and to the military.
Sisi: Is that why they all turned against you?
Morsi: Youx2019;re repeating your own propaganda. We are struggling together on the streets of Egypt, as we speak.
Sisi: Thatx2019;s all fascinating, and I would love to stay and chat some more with you; truly entertaining. But I have presidential duties to attend to. I am sure you also have plenty to dox2026; chuckleTahya Masr.
Morsi: Youx2019;re running away because you have no arguments and no answers.
Sisi: Running away! I tell you what; Ix2019;ll come back on Wednesday to finish our conversation. And Ix2019;ll have a surprise for you.
Morsi: Go with Godx2019;s curse upon youx2026;
Sisi: Tahya Masr.
