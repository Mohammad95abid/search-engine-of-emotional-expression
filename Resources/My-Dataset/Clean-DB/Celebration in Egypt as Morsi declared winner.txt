The Muslim Brotherhoodx2019;s Mohamed Morsi has officially won Egyptx2019;s presidential election and will be the countryx2019;s next president, the electoral commission has announced.
Morsi picked up 13.2 million votes out of just over 26 million, giving him about 51 per cent of the vote. His competitor, Ahmed Shafik, the final prime minister under Hosni Mubarak, received 12.3 million. More than 800,000 ballots were invalidated.
The president-elected delivered a victory address on Sunday night. He spoke on state television, long a medium which demonised him and the Muslim Brotherhood. He thanked the Egyptian people for their votes, calling them x201C;my familyx201D; and x201C;my beloved,x201D; and promised to work to x201C;restore their rights.x201D;
x201C;I have no rights, only responsibilities,x201D; Morsi said. x201C;If I do not deliver, do not obey me.x201D;
He also reached out to the army, the police, and Egyptx2019;s intelligence services, thanking them for their work in protecting the country, and promised to x201C;preservex201D; the military.
Congratulations from abroad
Tens of thousands of people flocked to Tahrir Square to celebrate Morsix2019;s victory, where they waved Egyptian flags and chanted x201C;God is greatx201D; and x201C;down with military rule.x201D;
Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Egyptx2019;s military ruler, congratulated Morsi on his victory, state television reported. Reactions also trickled in from around the region: The governments of Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the Palestinian Authority congratulated the winner.

Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in a statement that he x201C;respects the outcomex201D; of the election, and x201C;expects to continue cooperation with the Egyptian administrationx201D;. Morsi made an oblique reference to Israel in his victory speech, when he promised to x201C;keep all international treaties,x201D; a vow which would include the 1979 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt.
The White House also congratulated Morsi, and urged him to x201C;advance national unity by reaching out to all parties and constituencies.x201D;
Bishop Pachomius, the caretaker pope of Egyptx2019;s Coptic Church, issued a short statement congratulating Morsi. The Coptic community makes up about 10 per cent of Egyptx2019;s population, and some were worried by Morsix2019;s candidacy, fearing that his government would restrict their personal freedoms.
Gehad el-Haddad, Morsix2019;s campaign spokesman, said in an interview shortly after the results were announced that Morsi would work to be a x201C;president for all Egyptiansx201D;.
The president-elect is expected to take his oath of office later this month in front of the countryx2019;s supreme court x2013; though a spokesman said on Facebook that Morsi would take the oath in front of parliament, the x201C;only elected institutionx201D; in the country.
The Muslim Brotherhood said in a statement that Morsi had resigned his positions in both the Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party, fulfilling a campaign pledge.
There was no immediate reaction from Shafikx2019;s campaign.
Political uncertainty ahead
Morsix2019;s victory caps off more than a week of behind-the-scenes negotiations between the Brotherhood and the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces SCAF. He claimed victory just hours after last weekx2019;s runoff election, based on unofficial numbers tallied by the Brotherhood, but the commission delayed its official announcement until Sunday.
In the intervening days, Khairat al-Shater, the Brotherhoodx2019;s political boss, met generals from SCAF at least once. Sources say they were negotiating exactly what powers the president will have.
Despite Morsix2019;s victory, many of those questions about his power remain unanswered.
x201C;This is not the end of the game, itx2019;s a start of a huge responsibility,x201D; el-Haddad told Al Jazeera.
x201C;It comes with more challenges, turning from being the largest opposition group in Egypt to leading the country with its national front.x201D;
Morsi retains the right to appoint the prime minister and cabinet. He has already begun talks o form a presidential team and cabinet that x201C;would truly represent Egypt after the revolution,x201D; according to a statement on the Brotherhoods Twitter account.
Shortly before the polls closed last week, the generals issued a decree sharply limiting the powers of the new president. It permitted him to declare war, for example, only with the approval of the military council.
SCAF will also keep control of legislative power, and the budget, until a new parliament is elected. Egyptians went to the polls in November to elect a legislature, which was dominated by the Freedom and Justice Party, but it was dissolved earlier this month after a high court ruling found parts of the electoral law unconstitutional.
Saad el-Katatni, the speaker of the now-dissolved parliament, also met with officials from SCAF, and told them that the Brotherhood would not accept the court ruling or the election-night decree. But it is unclear whether the Brotherhood ultimately accepted those decisions in exchange for the presidency.
Either way, the military council x2013; which has promised to hand over power to a civilian government on June 30, in a x201C;grand ceremonyx201D; x2013; will remain a powerful force in Egyptian politics, despite the election of a civilian president.
