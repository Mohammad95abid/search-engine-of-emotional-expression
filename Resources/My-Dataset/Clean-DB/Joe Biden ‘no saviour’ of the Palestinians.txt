In October 1973, newly elected Delaware Senator Joe Biden visited Israel on his first official overseas trip and met Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
The 30-year-old was visibly moved as Meir explained what she said was Israelx2019;s militarily dangerous situation surrounded by x201C;enemy statesx201D;, but he cheered up when the Israeli leader revealed what she said was Israelx2019;s secret weapon: The Israelis have nowhere else to go.
Biden has retold this story countless times, describing the event as x201C;one of the most consequential meetings Ix2019;ve ever had in my lifex201D;.
It marked the beginning of his unwavering support for Israel and close ties with many Israeli leaders since then.
Biden is an outspoken supporter of Israel File: Ariel Shalit/AFPFast forward 13 years later when Biden delivered an impassioned speech to the US Senate, making it clear that American interests are closely tied to those of Israel.
x201C;Itx2019;s about time we stop apologising for our support for Israel,x201D; he told lawmakers in June 1986. x201C;It is the best $3bn investment we make. If there werenx2019;t an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interests in the region.x201D;
The following year marked the beginning of the annual $3bn of military aid Israel continues to receive from the US.
Biden, a self-avowed Zionist, has attended many pro-Israeli lobby group meetings, such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC and J Street.
His victory on Saturday over Donald Trump in one of the closest US presidential elections has been received with a sigh of relief from Palestinian officials x2013; not so much for his winning but more for Trump losing.
Trump and the Palestinian leadership
Under the Trump administration, the past four years have radically changed the political landscape for Israelis and Palestinians. While the US has always been a huge backer of Israel x2013; peddling the two-state solution line over the years, even as Israel continued to expropriate Palestinian land and build more settlements x2013; Trump took this policy to new heights.
He cut off US aid to the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, formally recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and moved the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. Trump refused to condemn settlement building and expansion as illegal x2013; in defiance of international law. He also withdrew funding to the UN refugee agency, which millions of Palestinians depend on for education, food and livelihoods.
Trump also brokered x201C;normalisationx201D; deals with three Arab countries who recognised Israel without so much as demanding Palestinian gains in return, leaving the Palestinian leadership increasingly isolated.
Through his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump devised a Middle East plan that eschewed the two-state solution x2013; which the Palestinian leadership heavily rejected.
Instead of a proposed Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with occupied East Jerusalem as its capital, Trumpx2019;s plan recognised Israeli sovereignty over major illegal settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian state would consist of cantons of non-contiguous land, and a capital in a suburb of occupied East Jerusalem.
So, will Joe Biden revert back to the accepted Middle East policy of previous US administrations, or will he continue on the path of some of Trumpx2019;s undertakings?















No strategic change in US policy
Several Palestinian news agencies carried statements by Palestinian officials with their perspectives on what President-elect Bidenx2019;s victory would mean.
Nabil Shaath, the special representative of President Mahmoud Abbas, said the Palestinian leadership does not expect a strategic change in US policy towards the Palestinians, but getting rid of the era of Trump x2013; which he described as x201C;the worstx201D; x2013; is an advantage.
x201C;From what we heard from Joe Biden and his deputy Kamala Harris, I think he will be more balanced and less submissive to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu x2013; thus less harmful to us than Trump,x201D; he said.
Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organizationx2019;s PLO Executive Committee, said while the first step is to x201C;get rid of Trump and the danger he posesx201D;, she stressed Biden will not be a saviour for the Palestinians.
x201C;The restoration of the Palestinian Authorityx2019;s relations with the US after Bidenx2019;s victory is under discussion and evaluation,x201D; she said.
x201C;Matters do not happen automatically,x201D; she added. x201C;Rather, the list of demands, interests and positions must be determined, and there is a need for a change in many issues.x201D;

America Detrumped!The world also needs to be able to breathe. Trumpism must be carefully scrutinized amp; remedied to restore the human, moral amp; legal equilibrium within and beyond the US. Such phenomena do not emerge from a vacuum. Now is the time for holistic amp; bold therapeutics
x2014; Hanan Ashrawi DrHananAshrawi November 7, 2020

Ashrawi said decades of pro-Israel US policy produced the Trump policies.
x201C;What is required is to change what Trump has done by radically changing the racism and politics he represented, and building a relationship based on a new vision x2013; justice, respect and clarity,x201D; she said.
In the same context, the head of the political bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, called on Biden to set x201C;a historic correction of the course of the unjust US policies against our people, which has made the United States a partner in injustice and aggression, and damaged the stability in the region and the worldx201D;.
Haniyeh called on the elected administration to withdraw from Trumpx2019;s Middle East plan and cancel the decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Settlements, Jerusalem, financial aid and BDS
While former President Barack Obama had a notoriously frosty relationship with Netanyahu, Bidenx2019;s personal friendship with the Israeli prime minister stretches back more than three decades.

Congratulations JoeBiden and KamalaHarris. Joe, wex2019;ve had a long amp; warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the U.S. and Israel.

While Biden is a strong proponent of the two-state solution, he refuses to leverage US aid to Israel in order to pressure it into abiding by international law.
x201C;I strongly oppose Israelx2019;s settlement policy on the West Bank,x201D; Biden told PBS in an interview last year. x201C;But the idea that we would cut off military aid to an ally, our only true, true ally in the entire region, is absolutely preposterous.x201D;
Biden also initially opposed the US embassy move to Jerusalem, but has already stated he has no intention of moving it back to Tel Aviv.
His administration plans to reopen the US consulate in occupied East Jerusalem to serve Palestinians, as well as the PLOx2019;s mission in Washington, DC, which was shut down by the Trump administration.
Biden said he will reverse the x201C;destructive cut-off of diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority and cancellation of assistance programmes that support Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, economic development, and humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gazax201D;.
But he has echoed the Trump administration by conditioning the restoration of financial aid to the PA only if it halts welfare payments to the families of Palestinian prisoners and alleged Palestinian attackers killed by Israelis.















x2018;Defeat BDSx2019;
On the issue of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions BDS movement, Biden is a staunch opponent and characterised it as x201C;wrongx201D; in a speech at AIPAC in 2016.
Tony Blinken, a senior adviser to Biden, said last summer the president-elect will push back against the BDS movement as well as efforts to denounce Israel for its violations of international law at the United Nations.
x201C;Will we stand up forcefully against it and try to prevent it, defuse it and defeat it? Absolutely,x201D; Blinken said.
Regarding the normalisation of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Sudan, Biden has previously tried to claim credit for sowing the original seeds under Obamax2019;s terms in office. Biden has urged x201C;Arab states to move beyond quiet talks and take bolder steps toward normalisation with Israelx201D;.
