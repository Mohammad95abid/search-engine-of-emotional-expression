President Donald Trump has denied seeingxA0;a memo by a senior United States official warning of mass casualties and economic devastation from the new coronavirus, months before the pandemic began inflicting thousands of deaths in the US.xA0;
Trump on Tuesday said he had not seen communications sent by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in late JanuaryxA0;warning of the serious threat posed by the coronavirus.
x201C;I read about it maybe a day, two days ago,x201D; Trump said when asked about the January 30 memo at a news conference. x201C;It was a recommendation that he had, I think he told certain people on the staff, but it didnx2019;t matter. I didnx2019;t see it.x201D;
Navarro, a China hawk, sent a memo on January 30 warning that the new coronavirus could create a pandemic and urging a travel ban for China, The New York Times reported. A second memo, written in late February and sent to the president, said the virus could kill up to two million Americans.
x201C;The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenceless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil,x201D; said one of Navarrox2019;s messages.
x201C;This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.x201D;
The US president continued to defend his actions in the early days of the crisis and played down Navarrox2019;s memos.

Navarro warned the coronavirus crisis could cost the US trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.
Report of earlier intel warnings
Trump said he was not aware of the memos, but that he unilaterally followed some of their recommendations, including taking steps to curtail travel from China.
But he said he would not have wanted to act prematurely when it was not clear how dire the situation would become.
x201C;I donx2019;t want to create havoc and shock and everything else. Ix2019;m not going to go out and start screaming, x2018;This could happen, this could happenx2019;,x201D; Trump said. x201C;Ix2019;m a cheerleader for this country.x201D;
Trump also denied knowing about US intelligence warnings that were reportedly made as early as November about a contagion that had the potential to lead to a x201C;cataclysmic eventx201D;.xA0;
ABC News, citing two unnamed officials, reported that multiple warnings were made late last year, including to the White House.xA0;
Asked about the report on Wednesday, Trump said he learned about the gravity of the crisis shortly before announcing travel restrictions on China on January 31.xA0;
Health experts have suggested the weekly death totals will reach a new high in the US this week. More than 14,500 people have died from the virus in the US so far, with about 424,000 confirmed infections.
 Nearly 800 people died on Tuesday in New York state, the epicentre of the US crisis.
Guidelines x2018;disregardedx2019;
Jeremy Konyndyk, a former Obama administration official who wrote guidance on health emergencies, said the memos clearly show Trump and his officials failed to take action on the threat of coronavirus.
He told Al Jazeera the emergency guidelines were specific on a fast-spreading respiratory disease and warned to x201C;trigger preparednessx201D;.
x201C;It listed a number of things that the administration should begin to do: diagnostic testing; ensuring the PPE personal protective equipment supply was sufficient; begin planning for mass-casualty events x2013; all of that was in there,x201D; said Konyndyk.
x201C;That was disregarded and I think it really isnx2019;t quite right to blame the WHO for our own lack of preparedness. If they would have followed that playbook, they would have begun kicking things into gear on January 30.x201D;
Former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat presidential candidate hopeful, blasted the US presidentx2019;s handling of the pandemic.
x201C;Coronavirus is not Donald Trumpx2019;s fault. But he does bear responsibility for our response and taking his duties seriously,x201D; Biden said. x201C;His failings and his delays are causing real pain for so many Americans.x201D;
Trump should use his powers under federal law to ensure the production of protective gear for health workers, offer healthcare coverage to those who have lost it, and coordinate statesx2019; efforts to procure supplies, Biden said on Tuesday.
x201C;Trump likes to say hex2019;s a wartime president,x201D; Biden said. x201C;Well, he needs to step up and act like it.x201D;
For his part, Trump hasxA0;redoubled hisxA0;criticism of the World Health OrganizationxA0;for its handling of the virus and threatened to suspend US funding to the United Nations agency.xA0;

Watchdog removed
Trump also removed the inspector general IG who was to oversee the governmentx2019;s $2.3 trillion coronavirus response, a spokeswoman for the officialx2019;s office said on Tuesday, raising concerns in Congress about oversight of the relief package.
It was the Republican presidentx2019;s most recent broadside against the federal watchdogs who seek to root out government waste, fraud, and abuse following his removal on Friday of the intelligence communityx2019;s IG, and his sharp criticism of the one who oversees the US Department of Health and Human Services.
Glenn Fine, the acting IGxA0;of thexA0;defence department, was named last week to chair a committee acting as a sort of uber-watchdog over the federal governmentx2019;s response to the coronavirus crisis, including health policy and the largest economic relief package in US history.
But Trump has since designated the Environmental Protection Agencyx2019;sxA0;IG as the new acting Pentagon IG, a spokeswoman said.
Congressional Democrats said Finex2019;s removal, less than a week after his appointment, reinforced their determination to strictly oversee the massive spending package passed last month to prop up the economy as the country grapples with the disease.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it x201C;part of a disturbing pattern of retaliationx201D; by Trump.
x201C;We will continue to exercise our oversight to ensure that this historic investment of taxpayer dollars is being used wisely and efficiently,x201D; she said in a statement.
Trump largely shrugged off a question about Finex2019;s removal, saying it was his prerogative.
x201C;We have a lot of IGs in from the Obama era. And, as you know, itx2019;s a presidential decision,x201D; Trump told reporters.
