Officially banned
Thirty Brotherhood members have been detained since the beginning of last month, including Rashad Mohammed el-Bayoumy, a 70-year-old university professor and senior member of the group.
The Islamist movement is officially banned in Egypt but it fielded candidates as independents in last yearx2019;s parliamentary polls and won a fifth of seats in the Peoplex2019;s Assembly.
With 88 of the chamberx2019;s 454 seats, the Muslim Brotherhood is by far the largest opposition force and has adopted a stance of challenging the governmentx2019;s policies during parliamentary sessions.
The Egyptian authorities can hold detainees for up to six months without trial under much-criticised emergency laws introduced in 1981 after Islamist militants assassinated Anwar Sadat, the president.
