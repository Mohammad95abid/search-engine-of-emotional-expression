Libyan renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar has backed a ceasefire in Libya to take effect from Monday, Egyptx2019;s president announced after talks in Cairo.
The development follows a series of military victories of Libyax2019;s UN-recognised Government of National Accord GNA against Haftarx2019;s forces.

He was speaking alongside Haftar and his ally, eastern parliament speaker Aguila Saleh.
El-Sisi urged international support for the initiative and called on the United Nations to invite Libyax2019;s rival administrations for talks.
The initiative, called the x201C;Cairo declarationx201D;, urged the withdrawal of x201C;foreign mercenaries from all Libyan territoryx201D;, he said.
El-Sisi added that the declaration also called for x201C;dismantling militias and handing over their weaponry so that Libyan National Army led by Haftar would be able to carry out its military and security responsibilities and dutiesx201D;.
The Egyptian president also said the initiative paves the way for forming an elected presidential council in Libya.
He added that it prevents x201C;extremist militiasx201D; from gaining control over the countryx2019;s resources.

Sirte offensive
Meanwhile, forces loyal to Libyax2019;s UN-recognised government said they launched an offensive on Saturday to seize the strategic city of Sirte.
x201C;The air force has carried out five strikes in the outskirts of Sirte,x201D; slain dictator Moamer Kadhafix2019;s hometown and the last major settlement before the traditional boundary between Libyax2019;s west and east, GNA spokesman Mohamad Gnounou said.
x201C;Orders have been given to our forces to begin their advance and to systematically attack all rebel positions,x201D; he added.
Sirte was taken by Haftarx2019;s forces virtually without a fight in January after one of Libyax2019;s myriad local fighters switched sides.
Libya plunged into chaos in 2011 when an uprising toppled and later killed longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi.
It is split between two rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by opposing fighters struggling for power.
Haftar has since last year sought to regain control over the west, fighting the GNA in an abortive attempt to seize the capital Tripoli.
