Bush said he believedxA0;Palestinians would sign a treaty with Israel to establish their own state before he leaves office in about one year.
xA0;
He said: x201C;And I believe itx2019;s possible x2013; not only possible, I believe itx2019;s going to happen x2013; that there be a signed peace treaty by the time I leave office in January 2009.x201D;
xA0;
Israeli pessimism

xA0;
In stark contrast to the US presidentx2019;s glowing optimism, two public opinionxA0;surveysxA0;showed Israelis were overwhelmingly pessimistic over Bushx2019;s visit to the region. Most of them did not think the visit would help in moving forward peace negotiations.
xA0;
The US presidentxA0;said he is convinced that both Israeli and Palestinian leaders understand x201C;the importance of democratic states living side by sidex201D; in peace.
xA0;
x201C;I am confident that with proper help, the state of Palestine will emerge.x201D;
xA0;
Abbas urged Bush to press Israel to halt Jewish settlements and ease security restrictions in the occupied West Bank that Palestinians say cripple their society and economy.

BadxA0;weather forced Bush to drive past settlements and the mammoth barrier Israel is building through the area, instead ofxA0;travelling by helicopter.
xA0;
x201C;Our people did not forget your invitation and committment to the establishment of Palestine,x201D; Abbas told his US counterpart.
xA0;
x201C;Peace in the world starts from here, from the holy land.x201D;
xA0;
Bush also urged Israel, which frequently mounts raids into the West Bank, not to take action that undermines Abbasx2019;s security forces.
xA0;
He said: x201C;There needs to be a fair amount of work to modernise the Palestinian security forcesx2026; my message to Israelis is that they ought to help, not hinder them.x201D;
xA0;
On the issue of the Gaza Strip, which largely operates independent of Abbasx2019;s government,xA0; Bush said: x201C;There is a competing vision in Gaza.x201D;
xA0;
He said the people of Gaza need to choose between Hamas, which has x201C;delivered nothing but miseryx201D;,xA0;and x201C;those who have negotiated a peace settlementx201D;, meant to underscorexA0;his optimismxA0;over an agreement between Abbas and Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister.
xA0;
Hamas forcedxA0;out Fatah and government forcesxA0;from Gaza in June last year. 
xA0;
Palestinian resentment
xA0;
In a move likely to draw Palestinian ire, Bush also said the two partiesxA0;should leave behindxA0;unimplemented UN resolutions, such as those calling for the removal of Israeli settlements and a right of return for Palestinian refugees.

x201C;What has to happen in order for there to be a peaceful settlement of a long-standing dispute is x2026; outlines of a state clearly defined.x201D; George Bush, US PresidentSend us your views.




He said: x201C;The UN deal didnx2019;t work in the pastx2026; this is an opportunity to move forward and negotiate a new deal.
xA0;
x201C;We can stay stuck in the past, which will yield nothing good for the Palestinian peoplex2026; or we can chart a hopeful path for the future.x201D;
xA0;
David Chater, Al Jazeerax2019;s correspondent in Ramallah, said Bush put on an x201C;appalling performance as far as the Palestinians here are concerned, theyx2019;re not hearing anything they want to hearx201D;.
xA0;
x201C;He kept using, time and time again, the phrase x2018;the universality of freedom.x2019; And he used it here, in Ramallah, thatx2019;s been the centre of 40 years of military occupation. What universality of freedom do the people of Ramallah have, or anybody in the occupied West Bank?
xA0;
x201C;The economy is being choked off, the freedom is being choked off, the dignity of the people is also being choked off by whatx2019;s happening under the occupation.
xA0;
In Bethlehem, where the streets were sealed by Palestianian security forces, Al Jazeerax2019;s Jacky Rowland said residents felt x201C;that their whole city has been put under curfew, effectively for a visit thatx2019;s for them devoid of meaningx201D;.
xA0;
After meeting Abbas, Bush was due to spend an hour touring the Church of Nativity before returning to Israel.
xA0;
The Palestinian minister of tourism said she had tried unsuccessfully to persuade the US president to take a walking tour of Bethlehem x2013; where the Israeli separation wall almost encircles the town, choking off its economy x2013; in order to understand the situation there.
xA0;
Rowland said: x201C;There really is a question of what extent hex2019;s going to get any sense of what life is like for ordinary Palestinians here.x201D;
xA0;
While in Ramallah, Chater added: x201C;Therex2019;s no sign at all fromxA0;his two press conferences that Bush is even aware of the massive feelings of resentment in the occupied West Bank.x201D;
xA0;
Outposts x2018;ought to gox2019;
xA0;
On Wednesday, the US president had begun his regional tour visiting Israel, and holding talks with Olmert.xA0;
Coinciding with renewed violence between the two sides, Bush told Israel to dismantle unauthorised settlement outposts and demanded that Palestinians halt rocket attacks.xA0;xA0;
Palestinian rockets were fired into Israeil on Wednesday, while an Israeli air strike killed three Palestinians in Gaza.
x201C;Ix2019;m under no illusions,x201D; Bush said at a joint news conference with Olmert in Jerusalem. x201C;Itx2019;s going to be hard work.x201D; xA0;Calling it x201C;an historic moment and opportunityx201D; for peace, Bush said Israel should remove Jewish settlements built without government authorisation in the occupied West Bank. xA0;x201C;Outposts, yeah, they ought to go,x201D; Bush said.xA0;Olmert has pledged to remove them but has not given a deadline.
xA0;
Peace groups estimate that there are currently more than 100 x201C;wildcat outpostsx201D; in the West Bank x2013; settlements that have not been approved by the Israeli government.
