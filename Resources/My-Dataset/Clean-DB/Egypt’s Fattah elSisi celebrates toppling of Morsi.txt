Egyptx2019;s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has celebrated the 2013 overthrow of the countryx2019;s first democratically-elected president by ordering a lavish military display in the capital and celebrations across the country.
Military jets roared over Cairo early on Thursday as Sisi addressed the nation in a pre-recorded address while his supporters were instructed to gather in the streets later in the evening after the breaking of the Ramadan fast.
x201C;On this glorious day, I would like to assure you that we are working hard to realise the hopes of the Egyptian people for the better future they deserve,x201D; Sisi said in an early-morning televised speech.
The official holiday, which the government refers to as the x201C;June 30 Revolutionx201D; was also marked with musical performances and free entry to museums.
x201C;The June 30 Revolution reasserts the impossibility of imposing a status quo on the Egyptian people. Anyone who imagines that he can successfully do that is deluding himself,x201D; Sisi said, alluding to Mohamed Morsix2019;s Muslim Brotherhood supporters.

Morsi was toppled by the military in July 2013 following days of street protests by Egyptians demanding that he be removed.
























Is Egypt better off under Sisi?





Sisi was the military chief at the time who led the takeover and ran for president two years later, winning the vote in a landslide.
Sisi has since launched a persistent and extensive crackdown and has declaredxA0;the Muslim Brotherhood a x201C;terrorist organisationx201D;.
Thousands of Brotherhood members have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment, while others are standing trial or being held without formal charges.
Sisi spoke of x201C;terrorismx201D; in his speech and warned against anyone attempting to break Egyptians and their x201C;hopes and dreamsx201D;.
Security was stepped up across the country x2013; where protests are effectively banned x2013; but the day was punctured by violence in the Sinai Peninsula where a Christian priest was shot dead and two members of the countryx2019;s security forces were killed in separate attacks.

Also on Thursday, six members of Egyptx2019;s security forces were killed in clashes with smugglers on the countryx2019;s western border.
The smugglers were trying to infiltrate Egypt from Libya, the military said in a statement, adding that several smugglers were killed.
On Wednesday, Sisi had appealed to security forces and agencies to stop anyone from x201C;spoilingx201D; the occasion.
In recent months, a growing number of Egyptians have begun losing patience with Sisi over corruption, poverty, and unemployment, the same issues that led to Mubarakx2019;s downfall, while Sisi has appeared increasingly defiant in his speeches.
In April, thousands of people marched Cairo in the biggest anti-government demonstrations since Sisi took office in 2014, shouting slogans such as x201C;Down with the regimex201D; and x201C;Leavex201D;, both of which were used during the 2011 revolution that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak.
