President Barack Obama has called for a one-year extension of tax cuts forxA0;families earning less than $250,000 a year, seeking to putxA0;Republicans on the defensive ahead of the November presidential election.
Obamax2019;s proposal, which attempts to reinforce his campaign mantraxA0;of being a middle-class champion,xA0;is unlikely to sway his opponents inxA0;Congress, who have argued consistently that the tax cuts passed by Obamax2019;s Republican predecessorxA0;should stay in place for everyone, including wealthy Americans.
White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters after Obamax2019;s remarks on Monday that the president would veto any bill that extended the tax cuts across the board.
x201C;Letx2019;s not hold the vast majority of Americans and ourxA0;entire economy hostage while we debate the merits of another taxxA0;cut for the wealthy,x201D; Obama said at the White House, standing inxA0;front of a riser filled with people who he said would be hurt ifxA0;their tax cuts were not extended.
Republicans charge that allowing taxes to rise for higher-earning Americans would hurt small business owners who are helping toxA0;create jobs in a tough economy, but Obama argued that 97 per cent of all small businessxA0;owners would fall under the $250,000-a-year income threshold.
x201C;This isnx2019;t about taxing job creators, this is about helpingxA0;job creators,x201D; Obama said.
Whether it gains traction or not, the Democratic incumbentx2019;sxA0;move achieves several political goals.
It shifts the campaign conversation x2013; at least for a day x2013;xA0;from last weekx2019;s meager jobs report and his handling of thexA0;economy to x201C;tax fairnessx201D; and inequality inxA0;America.
It burnishes Obamax2019;s message of being the candidate whoxA0;backs the middle class while Republicans and their presumptivexA0;presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, favour the wealthy.
It also sets a baseline for what is likely to be axA0;months-long debate about deficit reduction.
Obama x2018;doesnx2019;t have a cluex2019;
The tax cuts enacted by Republican President George W. Bush,xA0;Obamax2019;s predecessor, will expire on January 1 without congressionalxA0;action, part of a so-called fiscal cliff that could hit the USxA0;economy alongside deep automatic spending cuts.
Romney has suggested Congress wait to act on the issue untilxA0;January, when he hopes to take office.
His campaign said on Monday Obamax2019;s move would amount to axA0;x201C;massive tax increasex201D; on families, job creators and smallxA0;businesses.
x201C;It just proves again that the president doesnx2019;t have a cluexA0;how to get America working again and help the middle class,x201D;xA0;Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said.
Aside from the Republican reaction, Obamax2019;s move holdsxA0;political pitfalls among his fellow Democrats, who are dividedxA0;about how to address the issue.
House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi hasxA0;suggested that the income threshold for extending tax cuts bexA0;set at $1 million a year rather than the $250,000 limit ObamaxA0;wants.
Some Democrats oppose any extension, while others are waryxA0;of allowing taxes to rise for higher earners because of itsxA0;economic impact.
