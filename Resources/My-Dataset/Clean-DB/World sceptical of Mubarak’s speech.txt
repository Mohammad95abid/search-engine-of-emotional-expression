Hosni Mubarakx2019;sxA0;defiant speech announcing that he would not resign as presidentxA0;but transfer some powers to hisxA0;deputy has failed to allay the concerns of the international community and pro-democracy Egyptians.
After meeting with his top national security team, Barack Obama, the USxA0;president, warned that the transfer of some powers from Mubarak to vice-president OmarxA0;Suleiman did not represent a credible and concrete change.
Obama added that Cairo x201C;must spell out a clear path to democracy.x201D;
x201C;The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate, meaningful or sufficient,x201D;xA0;he said in a statement.
Echoing Obamax2019;s position, thexA0;European Unionx2019;s foreign policy chief said Mubarakx2019;s remarks did not allay the concerns of the Egyptian people and the international community.
In a statement, Catherine Ashton said x201C;the time for change in Egypt is nowx201D;.
x201C;President Mubarak has not yet opened the way to faster and deeper reforms,x201D; she said, adding that the EU would continue to x201C;engage with the Egyptian authorities to convey the need for an orderly, meaningful and lasting democratic transitionx201D;.
x2018;Limited influencex2019;
Also speaking after Mubarakx2019;s speech, Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said the announcement was x201C;unavoidablex201D;, and that he hoped Egypt would establish a healthy democracy rather than a x201C;religious dictatorshipx201D; when Mubarak eventuallyxA0;leaves office.
William Hague, the British foreign minister said his country was calling for x201C;an urgent but orderly transition to a broadly-based government in Egyptx201D;.

But hexA0;stressed that Britain did not seek to meddle in Egyptian affairs, and that x201C;the solution to this has to be owned by the Egyptian people themselves.x201D;
Hague saidxA0;it is not clear what powers Mubarak is handing over to his deputyxA0;Suleiman.
Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, said Mubarakx2019;s speech x201C;was not the hoped for step forwardx201D;.
However the Danish prime minister has been the only EU leader who has directly and publicly urged Mubarak to stand down since Thursdayx2019;s speech.
x201C;Mubarak is history, Mubarak must step down,x201D; Lars Loekke Rasmussen said in Copenhagen, the capital, on Friday.
Barnaby Phillips, Al Jazeerax2019;s correspondent in London, said despite their comments, Western leaders x201C;know that their ability to influence events is very, very limitedx201D;.
x201C;Ashtonx2019;s attempts to actually visit Egypt have been consistently rebuffed by the government there, who say that they are simply too busy to cope with her visit.
x201C;And wex2019;ve seen over the last few weeks how difficult it is for the Americans to really influence events on Egypt,x201D; he said.
Ehud Barak, the Israeli defence minister, saidxA0;it was not for foreign governments to decide what was best for Egypt.
x201C;We should not pretend that we are more important for the Egyptian people than their own interests.xA0; I donx2019;t think I have to respond on this.xA0; Itx2019;s up to the Egyptian people to find a way and do it according to their own constitution, norms and practices,x201D; he said in comments delivered at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Earlier in the day, Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, responded to reports that Mubarak may resign by saying that he hoped whoever replaced him would uphold Egyptx2019;s peace treaty with Israel, according to an Israeli radio report.
