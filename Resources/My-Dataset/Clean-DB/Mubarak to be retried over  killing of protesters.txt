Egyptx2019;s Court of Cassation has ordered that former president Hosni Mubarak should be retried over the killing of protesters in 2011.
The judge accepted the public prosecutionx2019;s appeal against an earlier court ruling that dropped the case against Mubarak last year. He said the retrial would begin on November 5.
Nearly 900 protesters were killed in the 18-day uprising against the former presidentx2019;s rule that ended when Mubarak stepped down in 2011, handing over power to the military.
The case against Mubarak, however, was concerned only with the killing of 239 protesters, whose names were cited in the charge sheet.
