Some analysts say the 34 amendments, which must still be approved in a popular referendum, are aimed at entrenching the ruling partyx2019;s grasp on power and will pave the way for Gamal, Mubarakx2019;s son, to inherit power from his father.

It would also mean civilians accused of x201C;terrorismx201D; could be tried in military courts.

The amendments, which also prohibit political activity based on religion, are expected to further restrict the already banned Muslim Brotherhood, the strongest opposition force in Egypt, quashing the groupx2019;s hopes for legal standing as a recognised political party.

About 270 Brotherhood members are in detention, with many arrested in the days leading up to the vote.

Critics argue that without the participation of the opposition parties the NDP lacked the moral authority to implement the changes.

Amnesty International, the London-based rights group, has called the amendments x201C;the greatest erosion of human rightsx201D; since emergency laws were enacted in Egypt in 1981 after the assassination ofxA0;Anwar Sadat, the then president.
