The x201C;this is our momentx201D; magic was gone. Liberals were defensive, the energy of 2008 replaced with the x201C;we-wish-it-werenx2019;t-sox201D; lament of dread pragmatism. Barack Obama had delivered a lot less change than hoped, expanding wars and oil drilling and inequality and generally proving to be much more of a standard-issue corporate spokesman than a bold, class-warring red. Even some of the die-hards were willing to concede that the US president hadnx2019;t quite lived up to expectations.xA0;
Still, ahead of the election he had one big thing going for him, as any liberal facing a leftist firing squad would tell you: He wasnx2019;t the other guy.xA0;
x201C;Whatever disappointments we have with Obamax2019;s first term x2013; and there are many x2013; progressives have a profound interest in the popular rejection of the Romney/Ryan ticket,x201D; declared The Nationx2018;s version of the editorial.
Beating those Republicans
After four years of Obama, members of the Liberal Commentariat were ever-so begrudgingly willing to concede that a man to whom they had devoted precious column inches drenching in we-are-not-worthy praise was not, sorry to say, the second coming. Still, as the presumed lesser evil, wex2019;d all be a little better off were he to get a second term, the narrative went. The morning after? The hard work of really holding him accountable begins. Youx2019;re darn tootinx2019;.xA0;
Then the guy won, defeating a Republican challenger with all the charisma of a jammed office printer. And liberals wept.xA0;
x201C;After Tuesday, Obama will have the opportunity to become one of the most celebrated presidents in history,x201D; remarked Chris Hayes of cable news network MSNBC, which didnx2019;t air a single story critical of the president in the days prior to the election. x201C;Years from now,x201D; Hayes continued, Obama could be x201C;seen as ushering in a new era of liberal governance in Americax201D;.








Inside Story US 2012Did US 2012 signify a shift to the Left?



x201C;Ix2019;ve supported many pols sic over the course of my life,x201D; gushed David Roberts, dropping the snark he brings to left-of-centre website Grist, x201C;but Obama may be the only one Ix2019;ve consistently admired.x201D; The president is more than just a politician, though. x201C;There arenx2019;t many male role models in our culture,x201D; Roberts added in the election afterglow. x201C;Lots of macho bluster. Lots of overgrown children. Nice to have a real man at the top.x201D;xA0;
Obamax2019;s victory means x201C;this was a consequential presidency in terms of policyx201D;, said Rachel Maddow, a regular guest at the White House and a host on its cable network. During his first term, Obama made significant strides x201C;in terms of civil rightsx201D; by allowing gays to fight his wars and delivered x201C;historic, historic change like health care reformx201D;. Onward and upwards.xA0;
Clara Jeffrey, co-editor of Mother Jones, summed up liberal sentiment when she posted a link to a slideshow of the president with the teaser: x201C;Awesome photos of Obama being awesomex201C;. If this was standing up to the most powerful man in the world, the principled progressive finally freed from vulgar electoral concerns, what would not standing up to him look like?
Basking in victory, the American liberal no longer maintained the hardened realism that manifested itself prior to the election, whatever earlier sense of regret that this is the best our system can do giving way to that long-lost earnestness one might on a cloudy afternoon call naivetxE9;; in some cases, careerism.xA0;
Others, of course, never even pretended: Dead Afghans and all, they always thought the president was pretty awesome. They like the image they were sold by his award-winning campaign x2013; that of a hip, sophisticated leader from a critically acclaimed televised drama x2013; and arenx2019;t too keen on the details, preferring instead to enjoy their product untainted.xA0;
Even if liberals disagree with something the president does, itx2019;s not going to do so x201C;with a lot of fussx201C;, as author Rebecca Solnit admitted prior to the election. After all, therex2019;s an endgame to think about: Beating those Republicans.xA0;

x201C;That means,x201D; Colonel Aureliano BuendxED;a said, smiling when the reading was over, x201C;that all wex2019;re fighting for is power.x201D;xA0;*

The makings of a president
Meanwhile, in Pakistan, x201C;The same person who attacked my home has gotten re-elected,x201D; one Debra Downer told the Reuters news agency, among thousands of victims of the presidentx2019;s drone wars. Since Obamax2019;s victory, x201C;the pressure on my brain has increased,x201D; the victim said. x201C;I remember all of the pain again.x201D;xA0;
One wonders, where is the American progressive to sooth the conscience? Who better to explain that itx2019;s nobodyx2019;s fault x2013; itx2019;s nobodyx2019;s fault, okay x2013; and that if you really think about, maybe we shouldnx2019;t ever dwell on this little massacre ever again because would it be better if Mitt Romney killed your family? Ignore the pain away, friend. And letx2019;s be honest: They werenx2019;t the worldx2019;s greatest kids.xA0;
Not confronted with the stench of rotting bodies, the wail of fathers who lost their children, the cry of children who lost their mothers, the silence when whole families are shredded and burned by our freedom, the American liberal is free to imagine Barack Obama as both a grand leader and something of a friend. Thanks to an award-winning ad campaign, Obama the product x2013; not the man, because who knows that? x2013; is smart, hip and sophisticated, or everything George W Bush was not. Hex2019;s nerdy but cool and what if he secretly follows you on Tumblr?xA0;
But herex2019;s the thing with that, friend. Barack Obama is the US President, which is to say: A bad person. A murderer. Since taking office in 2009, Obama has authorised attacks that have killed hundreds if not thousands of innocent men, women and children in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya and Somalia.xA0;
He waived restrictions on selling arms to countries known to use child soldiers. Hospitals in Iran are running out of basic medical supplies because of the x201C;cripplingx201D; sanctions he boasts of imposing.xA0;
At home, the US enjoys the largest prison population in world history, with more than two million human beings behind bars. Alas, in four years Obama did not find a single soul worthy of his awesome power to pardon and free.xA0;
If I had a friend like that, I probably wouldnx2019;t be friends with them anymore.xA0;
To the presidentx2019;s supporters, as with most Americans, though, these are mere details, certainly not character flaws. Maybe the overseas killing and domestic jailing is uncouth, but the disagreement isnx2019;t visceral; therex2019;s no urgency to it. The blood is real, but letx2019;s not go around saying itx2019;s on anyonex2019;s hands. Itx2019;s not like the Republicans or the god awful public are any better, the story goes, so best not worry our pretty little minds about the things in life you canx2019;t change. Plus it helps us in the heartland.xA0;

x201C;Theyx2019;re tactical changes,x201D; one of the delegates replied. x201C;Right now the main thing is to broaden the popular base of the war. Then wex2019;ll have another look.x201D; *

The limits of political liberalism
If onex2019;s progressive values are more than just a social media-savvy posture, a guy like Barack Obama canx2019;t be your friend or your winking ally. When a charismatic political figure co-opts your cause to implement a reactionary, literally murderous agenda, the impulse should be to fight back, not roll over or send an open letter.xA0;
But liberal discontent with Obama and his agenda has long been overstated. At a recent Netroots Nation, a conference for white liberals, the president enjoyed an 84 per cent approval rating just months after doubling the number of troops in Afghanistan and saving oil giant BP from bankruptcy after it poisoned the Gulf of Mexico under his watch.xA0;
Meanwhile, the vast majority of self-described x201C;liberal Democratsx201D; support Obamax2019;s liberal use of drones x2013; more than three-fourths, according to one poll x2013; because hey, at least theyx2019;re not Americans dying.xA0;
Make no mistake: Barack Obamax2019;s presidency is a liberal one. His support among progressives isnx2019;t reluctant, but enthusiastic and overwhelming. His approval rating among Democrats hovers at 90 per cent. Theyx2019;re infatuated with their teamx2019;s star player, especially now coming after a big win. They want to give him a mixtape and make silly faces together in one of those photo booths at the mall.
x201C;He is not the Word made flesh, but the triumph of word over flesh, over colour, over despair,x201D; says Ezra Klein, a liberal writer for The Washington Post.xA0;
x201C;I think hex2019;s smarter than me, better informed, better able to understand the consequences of his actions, and more farsighted,x201D; says Kevin Drum, a blogger for Mother Jones. x201C;If he and I were in a room and disagreed about some issue on which I had any doubt at all, Ix2019;d literally trust his judgment over mine.x201D;xA0;
Obamax2019;s could be x201C;one of the truly great presidenciesx201D;, says Chris Hayes.xA0;
You get the idea.xA0;
We donx2019;t know Obamax2019;s heart, if deep down inside the man weeps for the children he kills like he wept in front of the campaign staff that brought him personal glory. We donx2019;t know if historians will consider Obama one of the x201C;greatx201D; American presidents, though if he kills enough people anythingx2019;s possible. But we do know that Barack Obama is a liberal, according to the vast majority of liberals, and a killer, a fact the vast majority of liberals are fine with.xA0;
The point isnx2019;t to indict one political faction when so many have failed us, of course, but to recognise the limits of political liberalism. Given a mandate for change, the president presided over a million-plus-per-year foreclosure crisis, formalised the use of indefinite detention and extra-judicial murder, and deported more immigrants than any president in US history. His signature achievement? A healthcare plan modelled off the one passed by his Republican rival.xA0;
This is the best liberalism can do, folks. If you want meaningful change, not just in the name at the top, it would be foolishness to turn to an American progressive with an Obama-Biden sticker on their hybrid. Their doctrinaire commitment to incrementalism and the Democratic Party has led us to today, a world where the rich get richer and the poor get bombed. And theyx2019;re pretty cool with that.xA0;
Maybe this is an indictment.xA0;

He was going to go on, but Colonel Aureliano Buendia stopped him with a signal. x201C;Donx2019;t waste your time, doctor,x201D; he said. x201C;The important thing is that from now on wex2019;ll be fighting only for power.x201D;xA0;*
