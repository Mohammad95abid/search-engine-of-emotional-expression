WillxA0;the emergency law ever be abolished during Mubarakx2019;s liketime?xA0;xA0;EPA



Egyptian parliament approved a request by the government to extend the countryx2019;s emergency law, in place for the last 27 years. The extension comes despite promises made in 2005 by President Hosni Mubarak to abolish this law.
The emergency law gives thexA0;Egyptian government broad powers to arrest and detain suspects without charges, refer civilians to military courts, close dissident publications and thwart demonstrations. 
It was introduced after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat during a military parade in 1981 and has been renewed every two years since.
In 2005 Mubarak promised to pass an anti-terror act to replace the emergency law. The act, obviously, has not been passed and the Egyptian government has used that fact to extend the emergency law.
But has this law served Egypt in its own x201C;War on terrorx201D;?xA0; Will it be ever abolished during Mubarakx2019;s lifetime?
