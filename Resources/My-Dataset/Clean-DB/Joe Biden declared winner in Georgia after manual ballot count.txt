United States President-elect Joe Biden has officially been declared the winner in the state of Georgia, flipping the historically Republican-voting state for the Democratic Party for the first time in decades.
The Associated Press news agency said late Thursday that Biden had secured Georgiax2019;s 16 Electoral College votes, stretching his lead to 306 Electoral College votes compared to US President Donald Trumpx2019;s 232.
The news agency declared Biden the winner of the tightly contested US presidential elections on November 7 after the former US vice president won key states Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin x2013; but the state of Georgia had been too close to call.
The APx2019;s victory call comes just after Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffenspergerx2019;s office announced that a manual audit of the presidential contest results had confirmed Bidenx2019;s narrow lead over Trump.
A hand tally of about five million votes was carried out under an audit required by a Georgia state law, AP reported x2013; and not due to any problems with election procedures or an official recount request.
The state has until Friday to certify results that have been certified and submitted by the counties, the news agency said.
The result of Georgia hand count came after the Trump campaign filed a slew of lawsuits in key states across the US, as the Republican president has alleged, without any evidence, that widespread voter fraud marred the elections.

Raffensperger welcomed the results of the statex2019;s manual count on Thursday evening, calling the process x201C;historicx201D;.
x201C;Georgiax2019;s historic first statewide audit reaffirmed that the statex2019;s new secure paper ballot voting system accurately counted and reported results,x201D; he said in a statement posted on his website.
x201C;This is a credit to the hard work of our county and local elections officials who moved quickly to undertake and complete such a momentous task in a short period of time.x201D;
Raffenspergerx2019;s office said that because Bidenx2019;s margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent, the Trump campaign can request a recount after the results are certified.
x201C;That recount will be conducted by rescanning all paper ballots,x201D; the statement reads.

Ben Adida, executive director of VotingWorks, a bipartisan non-profit group that helps states conduct election audits, said the Georgia audit confirming Biden as the winner x201C;should give voters increased confidence in the resultsx201D;.
x201C;The difference between the reported results and the full manual tally is well within the expected error rate of hand-counting ballots, and the audit was a success,x201D; Adida said in the Georgia secretary of statex2019;s statement.
Votes that had not previously been counted were found in several counties during the Georgia audit, which required recertification of the election results in those counties, the AP reported.
The news agency said that in Floyd County, in the statex2019;s northwest, more than 2,500 ballots were discovered during the audit that had not previously been scanned x2013; and Raffenspergerx2019;s office had called for the firing of the countyx2019;s chief elections clerk.
Several other counties found memory cards with votes that had not been uploaded and counted prior to the audit, AP also said.
