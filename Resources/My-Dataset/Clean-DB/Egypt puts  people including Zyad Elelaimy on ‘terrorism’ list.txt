Egypt has added 13 people, including former legislator Zyad Elelaimy, on the countryx2019;s x201C;terrorism listx201D; for collaborating with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.
Saturdayx2019;s decision, published in the official gazette, stated that their x201C;placement on the terrorism list will be for a period of five yearsx201D;.
Elelaimy, a key figure of Egyptx2019;s 2011 popular uprising that toppled longtime President Hosni Mubarak, was arrested in June 2019.
Also put on the list was Ramy Shaath, a prominent activist who holds Egyptian citizenship and was arrested two months after Elelaimy.
Since their arrest, the pair have been charged with joining a x201C;terrorist groupx201D;, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been outlawed following the 2013 overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi.
In its ruling Saturday, the court said Brotherhood members had tasked x201C;other members of the group x2026; including Ramy Shaath and Zyad al-Elaimyx201D; with carrying out activities against the state.

Defence lawyer Khaled Ali told AFP news agency the decision was taken in the absence of the lawyers and would be appealed.
Hundreds of people have been added to Egyptx2019;s terrorism list in recent years, including fugitives and people arrested by authorities.
The measure authorises the authorities to freeze their assets while those who are not behind bars are banned from travel.
Authorities have arrested thousands of Morsi supporters since his removal, as well as secular activists, journalists, lawyers and academics.
