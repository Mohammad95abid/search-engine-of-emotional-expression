Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, said Egyptx2019;s deposed president Mohamed Morsi was x201C;wellx201D; after meeting him for two hours, his first known contact with the outside world sincexA0;he wasxA0;toppled by the armyxA0;earlier this month.
In a press conference on Tuesday, Ashton said Morsi x201C;has access to information, in terms of TV, newspapers, so we were able to talk about the situationx201D;.
She refused to comment on the substance of their conversation, sayingxA0;x201C;I told him that I was not going to represent his viewsx201D;.
Morsi has been held incommunicado since the military had removed him from power on July 3. Early on Wednesday, the state news agency confirmed that a delegation led by former Malian President Alfa Omar Konari also held a one-hour long meeting with the deposed president.
Egyptx2019;s authorities say Morsi is being investigated for charges including murder, stemming from a 2011 jailbreak when he escaped detention during the revolution that toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak.
Later on Tuesday, speaking alongside interim vice president Mohamed El Baradei, Ashton said EU diplomats would be in Egypt to continue efforts to mediate an end to the crisis.
x201C;I will come back,x201D; she said, adding it was up toxA0;Egyptian politicians to x201C;make the right decisionsx201D;.
El Baradei said he was optimistic sit-ins by the MuslimxA0;Brotherhood, which is protesting against the armyx2019;s overthrow ofxA0;President Mohamed Morsi could be ended peacefully.
x201C;Once wexA0;contain the violence that is taking place, then there will bexA0;room for a peaceful way to disband the demonstrations inxA0;different parts of the country and go into a serious dialogue,x201D;xA0;he said.
The political turmoil has divided Egypt, with hundreds of thousandsxA0;taking to the streets inxA0;rival rallies for and against military rule. Tension increased further afterxA0;scores were killed at a rally in support ofxA0;MorsixA0;in Cairo on Saturday.
Protesters warned
Mondayx2019;s meeting with AshtonxA0;came as Morsix2019;s supporters marched towards security headquarters in Cairo,xA0;despite a warning from the National Defence CouncilxA0;that it would take x201C;decisive and firm actionx201D; against demonstrators if they went beyond their right to peaceful protest.
The marches began after supporters ofxA0;Morsi broke their Ramadan fast. Groups moved from their key sit-in site by the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in Cairo towards the interior ministry and two other security forces buildings.
Thousands of demonstrators, men and women, chanted slogans against army chief General Abdel Fattah El Sisi.
Earlier, the Anti-Coup Alliance of groups protesting against Morsix2019;sxA0;removal also called for a massive turnout for demonstrations on Tuesday.
They urged Egyptians x201C;to go out into the streets and squares, to regain their freedom and dignity x2013; that are being usurped by the bloody coup x2013; and for the rights of the martyrs assassinated by its bulletsx201D;.
Ashton also met El Sisi, interim president, Adly Mansour, and representatives of the pro-Morsi coalition.xA0;
x201C;There were no initiatives presented by Ashton or us, she just heard updates on the situation since her last visit,x201D; said Mohamed Ali Bishr, a pro-Morsi delegation member.
The bloodshed in the Arab worldx2019;s most populous nation hasxA0;caused mounting international concern, and Washington on Monday x201C;stronglyx201D; condemned the violence.
A group of Egyptian NGOs issued a statement on Monday calling for the Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim to be sacked for what it called Saturdayx2019;s x201C;massacrex201D;.
A crackdown on Morsi supporters continued on Monday, with the arrest of the president and vice president of the moderate Islamist Wasat party, which has protested against Morsix2019;s removal.
