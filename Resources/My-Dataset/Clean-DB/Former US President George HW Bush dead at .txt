Less than a year after taking office, Bush sent troops to invade Panama and overthrow Manuel Noriega, a corrupt military ruler who had turned against the US.
The defining moment of Bushx2019;s presidency came in August 1990, when Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait.xA0;
Bush famously vowed: x201C;This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.x201D;
He worked closely with the UN and assembled a coalition of 32 nations to drive Iraqi forces out.
American troops flooded into Saudi Arabia and established bases x2013; a development that was later cited by Osama Bin Laden to justify attacks against the US.
Once under way, the war did not last long as Iraqi forces fled Kuwait. But Bush refused to order an advance towards Baghdad, opting not to topple Saddam.
In the aftermath of the war, Bushx2019;s popularity quickly began to fade and he lost the 1992 election amid criticism of his handling of domestic affairs, including a weak economy.
x2018;Mixed legacyx2019;
Joe Watkins, former aide to Bush senior, told Al Jazeera that the former president will be x201C;remembered very fondly, very warmly around the worldx201D; because of his foreign policy achievements.
Under his watch, the Berlin Wall came down, the Warsaw Pact disintegrated and the Soviet satellites fell out of orbit.
The other battles he fought as president, including a war on drugs and a crusade to make American children the best educated in the world, were not so decisively won.
Bill Schneider, a Washington-based political analyst, called Bushx2019;s legacy x201C;very mixedx201D;.
x201C;He had one of the greatest triumphs of foreign policy in US history, which was the Gulf War. He also had one of the greatest political collapses of US history,x201D; Schneider told Al Jazeera.
x201C;About a year and a half after he won the Gulf War, he was finished politically because the country went into a deep recession, and he didnx2019;t seem to have a plan to get the US out of it.x201D;
After retiring from public life, Bush fulfilled a wartime pledge to one day jump out of a plane for fun and famously went skydiving on his 75th, 80th, 85th and 90th birthdays.
He joined Clinton to raise funds for victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2011, Obama awarded Bush the highest US civilian honour, the Medal of Freedom.
