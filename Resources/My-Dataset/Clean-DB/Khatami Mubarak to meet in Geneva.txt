Iran severed diplomatic relations with Egypt after the 1979 revolution and criticised it for its ties with Israel, but the two countries have been making placatory noises in the recent past.
Egypt and Iran do not have full diplomatic links, but maintain representative offices in Tehran and Cairo.
An Iranian official in Tehran said the closest contact between Khatami and Mubarak had been a telephone conversation two years ago.
The naming of a Tehran street after Islambouli, who assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981, has been a major sticking point in Iranx2019;s efforts to improve ties with Egypt. 
Cairo has said that if the street was renamed it would remove a major obstacle to better relations.
