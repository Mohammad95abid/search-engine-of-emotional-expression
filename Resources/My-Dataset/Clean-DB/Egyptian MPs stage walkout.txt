The government argues that the amendments will enable the state of emergency, in place since the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat, the previous president,xA0;to be lifted.
xA0;
AI rejected the argument and said in a statement the changes would x201C;give the misuse of those powers a bogus legitimacyx201D;.
