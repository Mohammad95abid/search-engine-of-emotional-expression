White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany hinted very strongly on Friday that one key reason for Donald Trumpx2019;s post-election behaviour is payback for those who wronged him throughout his presidency.
x201C;In 2016, President Trump became the duly-elected president. Many sought to undermine him, discredit him, delegitimise him and deny his victory,x201D; McEnany told reporters at the White House as she wrapped up a news conference.
x201C;There were no calls for unity. There were no calls for healing. So, while every legal vote is counted, let us not forget the inexcusable transition or lack thereof that President Trump had to endure in 2016 and four years into his presidency.x201D;
The inaccuracies in her statement aside, this is a giant window into the presidentx2019;s mindset and echoes a recent report that he is trying to x201C;get backx201D; at Democrats for questioning the legitimacy of his election.
McEnany unveiled a litany of Trumpx2019;s grievances, from the completely untrue x2013; x201C;this president was never given an orderly transition of powerx201D;, x201C;there were no calls for unityx201D;, and the x201C;Mueller investigation which x2026; exonerated President Trumpx201D; x2013; to the true: x201C;You had 70 lawmakers say, x201C;Wex2019;re not coming to his inauguration.apos;x201D;















Trump has always branded himself a fighter.
As he wrote in x201C;The Art of the Dealx201D; in 1987, x201C;when people treat me badly or unfairly or try to take advantage of me, my general attitude, all my life, has been to fight back very hardx201D;.
There is no question that Democrats, who were the daily targets of Trumpx2019;s fury and insults during the 2016 presidential campaign, pushed back quite hard after he won. Green Party candidate Jill Stein, with the support of Hillary Clintonx2019;s campaign, pursued recounts in key battleground states.
Many Democrats, including Clinton in 2019, called Trumpx2019;s presidency x201C;illegitimatex201D; and nearly 70 skipped Trumpx2019;s inauguration in 2017. House Democrats impeached him in 2019.
McEnany suggested these x2013; and many other grievances, including all aspects of the x201C;Russia collusionx201D; investigation x2013; are part of Trumpx2019;s refusal to concede to President-elect Joe Biden, as Clinton did the day after Trump was declared the winner in 2016.
Trump is still refusing to begin the presidential transition process, keeping up his legal and recount efforts in several states, and pursuing unprecedented manoeuvres to overturn the will of American voters.
So, the US can only watch and wait as Trumpx2019;s revenge tour plays out x2013; a tour that numerous historians, election law experts, and even some fellow Republicans argue is delegitimising election integrity and imperilling democracy.
