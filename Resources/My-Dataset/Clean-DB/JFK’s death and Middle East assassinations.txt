Beirut, Lebanon x2013; He was the young, charismatic US president who took his nation by storm, only to be cut down in his prime by the determined actions of a lone gunman x2013; or, as many would believe, the efforts of a wider conspiracy.
That man was John Fitzgerald Kennedy x2013; otherwise known as JFK x2013; and Friday marks 50 years since he was gunned down in his open-topped car as he travelled in a motorcade through the streets of Dallas, Texas. 
His death not only paved the way for Lyndon B Johnson, JFKx2019;s vice-president, to unexpectedly become the 36th commander-in-chief of the United States, but also sparked a litany of conspiracy theoriesxA0;that continue to resonate a full half-century later.

As JFKx2019;s assassination anniversary sets off another round of claims and counter-claims over the circumstances of his demise, many in the Middle East will perhaps lament their own political dead, a list that surely overshadows the four sitting American presidents and other high-profile figures of power in the US who met an untimely death at the hands of an assassin.
The bloody realms of the Middle Eastx2019;s most infamous assassinations have laid the fate of the region itself. Egypt, Jordan, Israel and, in too many cases, Lebanon have all played host to shocking political murders that, like the killing of JFK, shook the surrounding region x2013; and even the world.
x201C;The assassination of Egyptian Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, in February 1949, engendered a struggle between Islamists and the state and in many ways continues to impact Egyptx2019;s political landscape,x201D; says Maurice Jr Labelle, a visiting scholar at the University of Saskatchewanx2019;s department of history.


Lebanon has always been a nest of vipers given the consociational democracy system that has been followed there. Coupled on this modern veneer of a republic, you have ancient bitter oriental clans with their eastern Mediterranean rivalries pitted against each other and where alliances are but fleeting.

x201C;Bannax2019;s x2018;martyrdomx2019; continues to serve as spiritual and political motivation for various Islamist movements and their struggles against secular regimes x2013; whether in Egypt, the Arab world, the ummah or the world itself. The ongoing conflict between the Brotherhood and the state is an important theme in Egyptian history and contemporary politics, as evidenced by the recent demonstration in support of former Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi.x201D;
Taking down leaders
For many analysts, the violent deaths of Egyptx2019;s president Anwar Sadat in 1981 and Lebanonx2019;s five-time premier Rafik Hariri in 2005 x2013; arguably two of the most prominent Middle Eastern statesmen of recent times x2013; are the closest regional comparisons to the bloody assassination of JFK himself.
x201C;Sadatx2019;s and Haririx2019;s assassinations are the obvious ones in terms of important local and regional impact,x201D; says Karim Makdisi, associate professor of political studies and public administration at the American University of Beirut. 
x201C;Sadatx2019;s death reflected regional popular discontent towards elite-driven compromise politics with Israel and the US. Haririx2019;s death is more important as a prism through which the US and its regional allies x2013; Saudi Arabia and Israel, in particular, but France and the UK, too x2013; prosecuted its x2018;war on terrorx2019; in the region and their battle against the Iran axis; and cemented the tactical move towards a Sunni-Shia split.x201D;
While both men were political giants whose deaths sent shockwaves through the Middle East x2013; Haririx2019;s demise led to the Cedar Revolution that was successful in ending Syriax2019;s decades-long hegemony over Lebanon x2013; neither, Makdisi tells Al Jazeera, possessed the kind of standing that caused the worldwide mourning that followed JFKx2019;s untimely death.
x201C;Neither of these two leaders had the kind of status that JFK had in US terms,x201D; explains Makdisi. x201C;Sadat was unpopular and there was not much remorse x2013; unlike in JFKx2019;s case x2013; while Hariri enjoyed JFK-like status, but only among his core supporters, not on a national or regional basis.x201D;
Too often forgotten, but just as significant, are those assassinations that have taken place in Iran.

A huge bomb explosion in the Islamic Republican Partyx2019;s headquarters on June 28, 1981 x2013; just two years after the Islamic Revolution saw the fall of the shah x2013; killed scores of prominent ministers and parliamentarians. Two months later, another bomb ripped through the office of prime minister Mohammad-Javad Bahonar, killing him and the newly elected president Mohammad Ali Rajaie.
x201C;That June 1981 assassination was very infamous in that it removed so many members of the Islamic Republican Party,x201D; says Burzine K Waghmar, a senior teaching fellow at SOAS, University of London, and a member of the London Middle East Institute. 
x201C;The Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organisation MEK, among other organisations, was held responsible. Following that assassination at the headquarters, the Revolutionary Guard and the regime really came down heavy, and from that day to this in 2013, wex2019;ve seen, in more ways than one, a police state: they dug their heels in and made it known that x2018;wex2019;re here to stay and this is our Islamic Revolution and republicx2019;.x201D;
x2018;Nest of vipersx2019;
Since it gained independence from France in 1943, Lebanon has been particularly plagued by assassinations x2013; with many remaining unsolved. Waghmar contends that such a grim record has its roots in the countryx2019;s political system, which has rarely facilitated the necessary means to deliver justice.


In all this, elite politicians and notables in the region have regularly served as the lubricant and beneficiaries of external political and economic hegemony, as well as the tool for suppression of popular revolts, movements, resistances and ideas.

x201C;Lebanon has always been a nest of vipers, given the consociational democracy system that has been followed there,x201D; he tells Al Jazeera. x201C;Coupled on this modern veneer of a republic, you have ancient bitter oriental clans with their eastern Mediterranean rivalries pitted against each other and where alliances are but fleeting. 
x201C;And, you find the most bizarre sorts, which only gives credence to the assertion that politics makes for strange bedfellows, and, if anything, Lebanon vindicates thatx2026; Itx2019;s like Sicily on the shores of Beirut.x201D;
While the Middle East has been shaped by its litany of high-profile assassinations in recent years x2013; the murder of Israelx2019;s Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and the startling new evidence surrounding Yasser Arafatx2019;s demise in 2004 are further examples x2013; Labelle argues that x201C;all political assassinations, whether in the United States or the Middle East, carry both short and long-term impacts, and Ix2019;m not sure if we can accord greater importance to those that are associated with Middle Eastern politics per sex201C;.
Makdisi, too, adds that while political deaths in the Middle East have been many and bloody, such murders are not the gravest of ills to have been inflicted upon this restive region.
x201C;That I reserve for the colonial betrayals, division of territories, and institutionalising of sectarian identities in the region on one hand, and the presence of huge oil and natural gas reserves and Israel on the other hand,x201D; says Makdisi. 
x201C;In all this, elite politicians and notables in the region have regularly served as the lubricant and beneficiaries of external political and economic hegemony, as well as the tool for suppression of popular revolts, movements, resistances and ideas. Political assassinations in this context are usually reflections of elite rivalry, foreign intrigue and, in some cases, popular discontent with craven political leaders.x201D;
