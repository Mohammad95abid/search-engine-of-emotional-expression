Sanders immediately congratulated his rival, while vowing to fight on for the partyx2019;s presidential nomination. x201C;This campaign is just beginning,x201D; he said in a statement.
x201C;We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina. Now itx2019;s on to Super Tuesday.x201D;
Al Jazeerax2019;s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Columbia, South Carolina, said that Clintonx2019;s win x201C;offers a tremendous psychological and political victoryx201D; ahead of Tuesdayx2019;s contests.
x201C;Sanders says he is not giving upx2026;but he is struggling to prove that he is a viable candidate,x201D; she said.
The win was Clintonx2019;s third victory in the first four Democratic contests, and solidified her status as the strong frontrunner to capture the partyx2019;s nomination for the November 8 presidential election.
The former secretary of statex2019;s victory also established her strength among black voters, a crucial Democratic constituency who make up more than half of the partyx2019;s primary electorate in South Carolina.
The result raised more questions about whether Sanders, the democratic socialist US senator from Vermont, will be able to compete away from his home base of Northeastern liberals.
