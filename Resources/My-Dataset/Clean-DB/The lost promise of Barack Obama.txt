Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was a 16-year-old American citizen killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. His name did not come up in the confirmation hearings for John Brennan to be head of the CIA. Or in Barack Obamax2019;s politically masterful State of the Union speech shortly afterwards. But he belonged in the same room as all the other invited guests who had been scarred by American violence. And his conspicuous absence revealed the hearings as a hollow sham, and struck a silenced note of discord in Obamax2019;s otherwise well-orchestrated speech.
It should be noted how skillfully Obama strung together a series of popular proposals, all of which Republicans oppose more or less vehemently. He may face daunting odds in getting anything passed through the GOP-dominated House of Representatives, but in his second term he seems determined to make them pay a price for their obstructionism. And yet, two systemic problems remain. First, Obama still wants bipartisan solutions, even though there are none to be had from the adversaries he faces. Second x2013; even more fundamentally x2013; hex2019;s rather pleased with the bipartisan approaches he can build on, regardless of the rotten fruit they actually bear.
Law and orders
Which brings us back to Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, and the profound silence surrounding him. His father, Anwar al-Awlaki x2013; also a US citizen x2013; was discussed at Brennanx2019;s hearing. He was also killed in drone strike, just two weeks before his son was killed. He was, most notably, the subject of a staged colloquy between Brennan and Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein, carefully tailored to present the case that Awlaki was a bad, bad man, citing multiple separate incidents he was allegedly connected to, including the Fort Hood massacre. But the US government never tried to make the case against Awlaki in a court of law. Indeed, elsewhere in the hearing, Brennan explicitly denied that drone strikes were intended to mete out justice x2013; thatx2019;s why the courts didnx2019;t need to get involved, he claimed.
Herex2019;s Independent senator Angus King of Maine cutting to the very heart of the problem with the Bush/Obama x201C;war on terrorx201D; so far as its constitutional lawlessness is concerned:

Having the executive being the prosecutor, the judge, the jury and the executioner, all in one, is very contrary to the traditions and the laws of this country, and particularly in a situation where there is time. A soldier on a battlefield doesnx2019;t have time to go to court. But if youx2019;re planning a strike over a matter of days, weeks or months, there is an opportunity to at least go to some outside-of-the-executive-branch body, like the FISA court, in a confidential and top-secret way, make the case that this American citizen is an enemy combatant.

And herex2019;s how Brennan responded:

Senator, I think itx2019;s certainly worthy of discussion. Our tradition, our judicial tradition, is that a court of law is used to determine onex2019;s guilt or innocence for past actions, which is very different from the decisions that are made on the battlefield as well as actions that are taken against terrorists, because none of those actions are to determine past guilt for those actions that they took. The decisions that are made are to take action so that we prevent a future action, so we protect American lives. That is an inherently executive branch function.

There are multiple problems with Brennanx2019;s response, not least the just-released Department of Justice white paper supposedly justifying the drone policy legally, which states that it x201C;does not require that the US have clear evidence that a specific attackx2026; will take place in the immediate futurex201D; x2013; which is to say, it does not require that an x201C;imminent threatx201D; actually be imminent. Rather, the white paper argues that an imminent threat can be deduced from other facts about the person targetted, specifically, about their leadership status within al-Qaeda or its allies and their ongoing involvement in planning terrorist activities in general. Replace x201C;al-Qaedax201D; with x201C;mafiax201D; and any seasoned Law and OrderxA0;fan will tell you thatx2019;s exactly the sort of thing we have courts for in the first place.
Brennanx2019;s response also raised the question of what Committee Chair Feinstein was doing by painstakingly painting al-Awlaki as such a threat. The obvious answer was that Feinstein was fearmongering, trying to cloud everyonex2019;s judgment, which has always been the US governmentx2019;s first line of defence against any questions surrounding the x201C;war on terrorx201D;.xA0; Thatx2019;s the bipartisan way this bloody failed x201C;solutionx201D; has routinely been sold by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
But itx2019;s a whole lot harder to cloud peoplex2019;s judgement when youx2019;re talking about the cold-blooded killing of a 16-year-old US citizen. Which is why Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was an unperson at John Brennanx2019;s confirmation hearing, as well as the State of the Union. The naked killing of an American teenager was simply too difficult to spin.
A lost promise
Of course there have been hundreds, if not thousands of other innocent victims of US drone strikes and related remote killings from Obamax2019;s kill list of al-Qaeda operatives and allies. But the story here, wex2019;re supposed to believe, is that wex2019;re killing so much fewer of them than we were during the height of the Iraq War. This, wex2019;re told, is progress. This is what hope and change look like.
MSNBCx2019;s Chris Hayes x2013; who represents the outer limit of acceptable discourse on elite US TV x2013;xA0;confronted this directly recently:

Would you rather, I am often asked by supporters of the kill list, that we have boots on the ground, big expensive, destructive deadly disastrous land invasions of countries like the Iraq war? Isnx2019;t the move from wars like Iraq to x201C;surgical strikesx201D; in Yemen precisely the kind of change we were promised?
This narrow choice between big violence and smaller violence shows, I think, just how fully we have all implicitly adopted the conceptual framework of the War on Terror,xA0;how much George W Bushx2019;s advisers continue to set the terms of our thinking years after theyx2019;d been dispatched from office. Because that argument presupposes that we are at war and must continue to be at war until an ill-defined enemy is vanquished.
What, people ask, is the alternative to small war, if not big war? And the answer no one ever seems to even consider is: no war. If the existence of people out in the world who are actively working to kill Americans means we are still at war, then it seems to me we will be at war forever, and will surrender control over whether that is the state we do in fact want to be in.

The possibility of no war simply doesnx2019;t exist anymore for so-called political realists x2013; x201C;crackpot realistsx201D; as C Wright Mills called them at the height of the Cold War. x201C;In the name of realism they have constructed a paranoid reality all their own,x201D; he wrote, and itx2019;s as true today as it was then. No war is unthinkinable for them, even though even the scaled-down war continues to make new enemies faster than the old ones can be killed all of the sudden, therex2019;s war in Mali. Progress! But the US isnx2019;t fighting there. More progress!. Such is the nature of the bipartisanship that Obama strives for, when it is achieved. And x2013; getting back to Anwar al-Awlaki and his son x2013; perhaps the darkest aspect of that bipartisanship is the erosion of traditional constitutional rights.










Inside Story AmericasThe two sides of Barack Obama



Itx2019;s not that I liked Anwar al-Awlaki or approved of what he did. Obviously I donx2019;t. But if he was being punished for past acts x2013; as the DOJ white paper and Senator Feinsteinx2019;s questions strongly indicate, then the courts simply have to be involved. Thatx2019;s what it means when we Americans proudly say, x201C;Wex2019;re a government of laws, not of men.x201D; And his son? The assasination of his son epitomised the all-pervasive moral bankruptcy of Americax2019;s x201C;war on terrorx201D;.
Let us be clear. No one is a worse advocate for al-Qaeda than al-Qaeda itself. Killing thousands of innocent civilians x2013; including MuslimsxA0;x2013; does not strike most people as a convincing demonstration that you are holy warriors rather than just thuggish criminals in service to a merciful and compassionate God. At the same time, no one is a better advocate for al-Qaeda than the American government, whose war-on-terror response to 9/11 was first to validate al-Qaedax2019;s previously imaginary status as warriors, then to validate al-Qaedax2019;s broader claim that America was at war with Islam itself. The assassination of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was a classic continuation of this same pattern, whereby Americax2019;s actions contradict everything America is supposed to stand for, and appear to confirm everything that al-Qaeda alleges. It represents an active rolling back of citizen rights to a pre-Magna Carta, pre-1215 era. Bush began this process with Guantanamo, with torture, rendition and detention without trial, but Obama, rather than rectifying things, has taken them even further with the targetted killing of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki. And in so doing, he has crushed the promise that he once seemed to exemplify.
Whatx2019;s truly tragic, though, is how few people seem to even notice that the promise has been lost.
A bipartisan abberation
Writing here earlier about x201C;The dangerous rebranding of John Brennanx201C;, Mark LeVine noted that x201C;Itx2019;s hard not to think of Hannah Arendtx2019;s idea of the banality of evil here, when reading through the memos and speeches and other attempts to bureaucratise the decision and execution of death sentencesx201D;. He went on to say:

As a recentxA0;Daily KosxA0;blog postxA0;reminds us, Arendt believed that the ability of large governing systems to perpetrate and perpetuate systematic evil depends not on the evil of the x201C;doersx201D;, but rather on an x201C;extraordinary shallownessx201D; of officials at all levels of power, one which reflects an even deeper-seated x201C;curious, quite authentic inability to thinkx201D;.
But therex2019;s a problem with such a dismissive analysis. Perhaps this description would fit former President Bush and his administration, which famously disdained the x201C;reality based communityx201D; in favour of creating fantasy versions that suited their own ideological and power narratives. But is President Obama really that shallow? Can he be said to possess an x201C;inability to thinkx201D;? Such an accusation is hardly plausible.

And thatx2019;s the problem in a nutshell. Itx2019;s not that Obama is unable to think x2013; itx2019;s that hex2019;s carefully, even rigorously trained himself not to. Just as when he turned his back on Jeremiah Wright for echoing Martin Luther Kingx2019;s prophetic condemnation of American militarism, one can almost hear Obama muttering to himself under his breath the early-80s punk lyrics of X, x201C;I must not think bad thoughts. I must not think bad thoughts.x201D;
Itx2019;s tragic, really. Obama certainly has the capacity to comprehend the sea of troubles he is sailing on, but he lacks the will, desire, and imagination to steer America into a fundamentally different direction. He cannot even begin to conceive of x201C;no warx201D; as an option x2013; indeed, as Martin Luther King would say, as the only option. He is Americax2019;s x201C;leaderx201D; in a decidedly limited, managerial sense, when history and the American people had cried out for so much more x2013; dare I say it? x2013; For a visionaryx2026; Or at least for a leader along the path that visionaries have lit before us. Instead, Obama is a go-along-to-get-along president who shares virtually all of the imperial operational mindsets, even as the ever-mounting costs of empire are tearing the American republic apart. Virtually all the aberrations from constitutional government that the neocons under Bush advanced have been continued under Obama, thus confirming them as bipartisan aberrations.
Which is why, tragically, itx2019;s America, indulging its own demons, that continues to make al-Qaedax2019;s case, in a way that nobody else possibly can x2013; certainly not al-Qaeda itself.
Itx2019;s not America alone, of course. Itx2019;s simply the way of empire, which the poets have always understood far, far better than the politicians have. It leads me to recall x201C;You, Andrew Marvellx201C;, Archibald MacLeishx2019;s haunting reflection on the fall of empires into darkness, from ancient to modern, from East to West, or Shelleyx2019;s sonnet, x201C;Ozymandiasx201C;, which ends,xA0;

My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!x2019; Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, The lone and level sands stretch far away.

Whoever thought that Obama would represent the American Republic against the empire must now acknowledge how terribly wrong they were. We were hoping for genuine bottom-up renewal, but instead just got more eloquent bipartisan decay. We were hoping for Langston Hughes, x201C;Let America be America Againx201C;. Instead, we got Shelley and MacLeish.
The state of our union is dire. Who dares say so? And why?
