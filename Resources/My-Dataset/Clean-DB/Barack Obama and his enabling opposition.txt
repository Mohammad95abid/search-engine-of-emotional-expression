The classic anti-murder talking point peddled by prophets and other long-haired purists has been that murder is wrong. Or, put another way: Murder is wrong. But if enough people die, a killer can often end up being labelled a statesman, the dark magic of democracy x2013; meaning the only real democracy, of course: the United States of America x2013; turning wanton destruction into a x201C;difficult decisionx201D;.
When the murderer is a liberal with a peace prize, itx2019;s even harder than usual to get any respect in the serious world sticking to a rigid, killing is bad belief system. And so, most ambitious political players donx2019;t, not even or especially in the Democratic Party and its media outlets. A more pragmatic stance is adopted. Careers must be thought of, after all.
Rather than outright condemning President Obamax2019;s programme of unilateral killing, for instance, the progressive Democrat finds ways to argue that mass killing by a guy they kind of like is different from all mass killings by other murderous sociopaths. Something about the social contract, maybe; or what might start out innocently enough as honest moral outrage over the slaying of women and children and other living things is, through the process of reform, stripped of its urgency and turned into: Why is there not some easily manipulatable bureaucratic process in place to lend legitimacy to all this arbitrary killing?
Thatx2019;s the stance of most centre-left politicians, in office and on TV. The critique of state-sponsored bloodshed, if it appears in liberal politics, is typically limited to the way the blood is being spilled x2013; wherex2019;s the rubber stamp? x2013; as if the problem is the typo on the death certificate and not what sent the body to the morgue.
Unmanned drones
Take that venerable liberal institution, The New York Times. Presented with evidence that the White House is killing whoever the president deigns to kill, the paper had a blistering editorial effectively calling for more paperwork. x201C;If the administration has evidence that a suspect is a terrorist threat to the United States,x201D; the editorial declared, x201C;it would have to present that evidence in secret to a court before the suspect is placed on a kill list.x201D;xA0;
A similar system is in place for electronic surveillance of alleged terrorism suspects. In 2011, every government request to conduct such surveillance was approved, though liberal guilt has been sufficiently assuaged.
But thatx2019;s just the Times, hardly a representation of American liberalism as a whole. What about all those fiery progressive congressmen? x201C;Yes, what about them?x201D; asks every military-age male in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.
Well, those fiery progressives essentially call for the same thing, taking issue with the form of unilateral assassinations, not the substance. US Congressman Keith Ellison, chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus x2013; the House of Representativesx2019; largest and traditionally least effective voting bloc x2013; embodies this self-neutering and perfectly respectable liberal opposition so prevalent in Washington. In an op-ed published in the Washington Post, Ellison laments the civilian deaths caused by his presidentx2019;s wars. Thatx2019;s a good thing, the lament, and not so common in his town.xA0;







xA0;US memo x2018;justifiesx2019; drone killings




But the gist of Ellisonx2019;s opposition x2013; essentially, x201C;Why isnx2019;t Congress signing off on these deaths?x201D; x2013; doesnx2019;t serve any real good. Indeed, rather than simply denounce the use of unilateral air strikes to kill foreign, poor and brown young people with guns who are not members of the NRA, Ellison dissents by praising imperial efficiency, which seems bad. x201C;Weaponised drones have produced results,x201D; he writes. In fact, x201C;just last week one took out a Taliban leaderx201D; the specific week is of as of much importance as a x201C;Taliban leaderx201D;. And, just so you know, unmanned drones x201C;lessen the need to send our troops into harmx2019;s way, reducing the number of US casualtiesx201D;.
That lessening the need to x201C;send our troops into harmx2019;s wayx201D; may actually increase the odds of future military interventions x2013; CNN doesnx2019;t care about dead non-Americans, nor do most Americans x2013; does not appear to enter into Ellisonx2019;s pragmatic progressive mind. Drones make it easier to initiate acts of war of dubious justness, but: fewer American flag-draped coffins, probably. So therex2019;s that.
Like many on the professional centre-left, the biggest problem Ellison seems to have with US drone policy is that it cuts politicians like him out. As Ellison puts it, x201C;unilateral kill lists are unseemly and fraught with hazardsx201D;. But he canx2019;t even bring himself to condemn the unilateral killer, bizarrely arguing that x201C;the president should be commended for creating explicit rules for the use of dronesx201D;.
x2018;Military necessityx2019;
Talk about unseemly. Thatx2019;s about the point where a lacklustre dissent becomes a dangerous legitimation of evil: when you praise a mass killer for having a system in place. Itx2019;s not like Chuckles Manson was just having anybody killed all willy-nilly, ya know.
Indeed, rather than oppose remote-controlled murder, Congress should work on x201C;codifying a legal framework to guide executive action on drone strikesx201D;, argues the most progressive congressman in America. This framework should x201C;require an independent judicial review of any executive-branch x2018;kill listapos;x201D;, or rather: the Timesx2018; idea of a clandestine court glancing at the presidentx2019;s assassination plans. As for civilian casualties, x201C;they are not acceptablex201D;, writes Ellison, x201C;exceptx201D; x2013; because thatx2019;s the sort of opposition wex2019;re dealing with here x2013; x201C;in cases of demonstrated military necessityx201D;.
Important bit of trivia: the number of strikes that the CIA and US military have claimed was not of x201C;demonstrated military necessityx201D; is precisely zero.
Typically, neutering onex2019;s opposition to evil is seen as savvy by those doing; it will help achieve incremental reform, the irrespective-of-results thinking goes, which would certainly be a good thing and how can you oppose a good thing? Itx2019;s the sort of alluring thought that leads peace groups to embrace drones and defence secretaries because, sorry young radical, thatx2019;s the best we can do. Itx2019;s what leads politicians hailed as x201C;bold progressivesx201D; to embrace reactionary pragmatism, at least if you believe their impulses are honest. But if progressive change is the goal, as opposed to co-opting progressive energy for purposes of the status quo, itx2019;s a damn bad idea.
The role of a person with conscience is to speak out in the face of injustice, not to play the role of a savvy pol and compromise onex2019;s dissent, a behaviour regrettably mirrored by many who are far from the limelight. If you want to end slavery, call for an end to slavery. If you want to reduce state-sanctioned murder, call for an end to state-sanctioned murder x2013; and leave it to your elected progressive to interpret that as the lesser evil of x201C;a few less dead foreign babiesx201D;.
Meaningful change, when it comes, usually does so as a result of radical demands, not well-it-would-be-awful-nice x201C;open lettersx201D; and pre-emptively compromised moral stands. When it comes to the unilateral murder of poor people on the other side of the globe, therex2019;s the right position x2013; stop it now x2013; and then therex2019;s the reasonable, progressive stand: maybe require a few more lawyers. The latter stance wonx2019;t save any Pakistanis, but then itx2019;s mostly about appearances. Dead foreigners donx2019;t make many appearances.
