Simon Pia has been at the cut and thrust of the Scottish political scene for too long not to spot a grim but mesmerising election campaign when he sees one.
A one-time media adviser x2013; or x201C;spin doctorx201D; x2013; to two Scottish Labour Party leaders at the Scottish parliament, the man from Edinburgh says he is sure who will win todayx2019;s 2016 US Presidential race, but is equally intrigued about how the American electorate became lumbered with the two most disliked presidential nominees in recent US history.
x201C;I think Hillary Clinton will win it,x201D; he told Al Jazeera. x201C;But I think what is interesting is that the Republican Party machine broke down and Donald Trump won the nomination, whereas it was the Democratic machine that ensured Hillary got the nomination.x201D;
Pia, today plying his trade as a journalism lecturer, told Al Jazeera that US support for Trump, whose late mother hailed from the Isle of Lewis, off the Scottish west coast, and whose golf course-owning ambitions in Scotland have caused great domestic controversy, was a big x201C;f*** you vote from Middle Americax201D;.
x201C;The only bit of credit I would give to Trump is that he is a master manipulator of the tabloid media,x201D; he added.
So is it safe to assume that Pia is praying for a Clinton victory?
x201C;I would vote for Clinton with a nose-peg x2013; I think she is tainted,x201D; he said. x201C;The one hope I have is that if Trump did win, hex2019;s such a narcissist, he would just be happy to be president and leave others to do the heavy lifting.x201D;
