Ukrainex2019;s prosecutor-general said on Friday that his office is reviewing several cases related to the owner of a gas company where former Vice President Joe Bidenx2019;s son sat on the board, as part of a review of all the criminal cases closed by his predecessors.
US PresidentxA0;Donald TrumpxA0; had pressed for such a review in a phone call withxA0;Ukrainian PresidentxA0;Volodymyr Zelensky, a x201C;favourx201D; that has now led the US Congress to begin an impeachment inquiry.
Prosecutor-General Ruslan Ryaboshapka told reporters his office would revisit about 15 cases, but stressed that they were not necessarily connected to Bidenx2019;s son, Hunter, who was hired by the oil company, Burisma,xA0;in 2014 at the same time his father was leading the Obama administrationx2019;s diplomatic dealings in Kiev.xA0;
Though the timing of Hunter Bidenx2019;s hiring raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.
x201C;We are conducting an audit of the cases that were earlier overseen by the Prosecutor-Generalx2019;s Office,x201D; said Ryaboshapka, who was appointed in August.
x201C;We are reviewing all cases that were closed or broken up into separate cases, to make a decision on whether this was illegal.x201D;xA0;

Ukrainian authorities have previously said the investigation into Burisma focuses on a period before Hunter Biden joined the companyx2019;s board.
Ryaboshapka also suggested the prosecutors may focus not on Hunter Biden but on Burismax2019;s founder Mykola Zlochevsky and other figures.
x201C;As far as we can see, this is more a question of Zlochevsky and Ukrainian businessman Sergei Kurchenko than Burisma and Biden,x201D; he said.
Ryaboshapka said he was not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.xA0;
Burisma says it is the largest private producer of natural gas and one of Ukrainex2019;s leading gas groups.

Ryaboshapkax2019;s announcement came a day after US House investigators released a cache of text messages provided by Kurt Volker, the former special US envoy to Ukraine who stepped down amid the Democratsx2019; impeachment inquiry.xA0;

Volker in the messages encouraged Zelenskyx2019;s aide to conduct an investigation linked to Bidenx2019;s family in return for a high-profile visit to Washington, DC, with President Donald Trump.
Ryaboshapka was mentioned in the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, who assured Trump that Ryaboshapka was x201C;his manx201D; and that he would resume investigations into Burisma.
The prosecutor-general insisted on Friday that he did not feel any pressure over the Burisma case.
x201C;Not a single foreign or Ukrainian official or politician has called me or tried to influence my decisions regarding specific criminal cases,x201D; he said.
Trump has maintained he has done nothing wrong and has described the impeachment inquiry as x201C;crapx201D;.xA0;
The US president on Thursday again invited foreign interference in a US presidential election by publicly calling on China to investigate Joe Biden despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing. Democrats called Trumpx2019;s remarks a x201C;fundamental breach of his oath of officex201D;.xA0;
