Trump campaign files fresh lawsuit in Arizona
The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit Saturday in Arizona that seeks the manual inspection of potentially thousands of in-person Election Day ballots in metro Phoenix that they allege were mishandled by poll workers and resulted in some ballot selections being disregarded.
The legal challenge against Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs looks at instances where people are believed to have voted for more candidates than permitted.
When tabulators detect such an x201C;overvote,x201D; poll workers should give voters a choice to fix the problem. But the workers instead either asked or told voters to press a button on the machine to override the error, leaving the devices to disregard the problematic ballot selections, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit was filed hours after the dismissal of another Arizona election lawsuit that contested the use of Sharpie markers in completing Election Day ballots in Maricopa County. Even though election officials have said voting with a Sharpie would not invalidate a ballot, many social media users in the controversy known as Sharpiegate have falsely claimed their ballots had been invalidated because they were told to use the markers.
Hobbsx2019; spokeswoman Sophia Solis said the secretary of statex2019;s office is still reviewing the lawsuit but added that the latest lawsuit x201C;is seemingly a repackaged x2018;Sharpiegatex2019; lawsuitx201D;.

Hundreds of people gathered in central Philadelphia to celebrate Bidenx2019;s win.
In the crowd, Raushanah Scurry felt excited that what she called x201C;the reign of terrorx201D; was over. x201C;Ix2019;m hoping the atmosphere of the country will change,x201D; she said. x201C;Ix2019;m hopeful that wex2019;ll work together.
Biden will be able to bridge the gap and try to find solutions for police reform. I have a good feeling about him.x201D;
Benjamin Blei joined the celebration with his wife and son. He also attended Black Lives Matter protests in Philadelphia for Walter Wallace Jr, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African-American victims of police violence. He supported Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primaries but voted for Biden in the general elections.
Blei said, however, that he plans to be critical of the Biden and Harris administration. x201C;Wex2019;re on a mission to change this country, and thatx2019;s the important thing, but you have to start with removing Trump and the people who are running his cabinet,x201D; he said.

Republican senator demands DOJ investigation of Pennsylvania ballots
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is asking the US Department of Justice DOJ to investigate allegations that postal authorities were backdating mail-in ballots.
Graham said the Trump campaign had received information from a postal worker in Erie, Pennsylvania who says that supervisors hatched a plan to postmark ballots mailed after the election and make them look as if they had arrived beforehand.
x201C;Itx2019;s imperative that all credible allegations of voting irregularities and misconduct be investigated to ensure the integrity of the 2020 election,x201D; Graham said.
x201C;I will be calling on the Department of Justice to investigate these claims. Ix2019;ll also be in contact with the Postmaster General, requesting he look into these allegations x2026;x201D; Graham said.
Pennsylvania law required ballots to be mailed by Election Day but allows them to be collected and counted for three days afterwards, which the Trump campaign is objecting to in federal and state courts.

US capital celebrates Biden victory
Al Jazeerax2019;s Jihan Abdalla sent this dispatch from Washington, DC
Thousands honked their cars, banged on pots and cheered in Washington, DC to celebrate the announcement that Joe Biden won the election over Trump.
Music blared and a festive atmosphere set in at Black Lives Matter Plaza as Biden supporters gathered x2013; most wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They danced and some drank champagne, straight from the bottle.
x201C;I could dance and scream all day long,x201D; Bernadette Etienne, a retired translator, told Al Jazeera. x201C;There is so much misery to expel, so much hatred to get rid of x2026; Itx2019;s been four horrible nightmarish years.x201D;
Streets were closed to traffic as large waves of people kept arriving to the sound of honking car horns and cowbells. Some waved American and LGBTQ flags. Many wore Black Lives Matter T-shirts.
x201C;I was getting ready for this day for a long time,x201D; Andrew Hasson told Al Jazeera. x201C;This week was super stressful just waiting for the results to come in, but this is a great feeling and DC feels alive again.x201D;

Al Jazeerax2019;s diplomatic correspondent: Reaction from allies x2018;pretty clearx2019;
James Bays, Al Jazeerax2019;s diplomatic correspondent, has said that with regards to the USx2019;s traditional allies, x201C;Itx2019;s pretty clear what the reaction isx201D; to Bidenx2019;s projected win.
x201C;They are not saying this publicly, but there is a massive sigh of relief now, and a feeling that perhaps things might return to how they were four years ago in terms of the transatlantic alliance,x201D; he said. x201C;Trump has described the European Union as a foe, whereas Biden has described it as an indispensable partner.x201D;
Bays added that a senior EU official had described the past four years during Trumpx2019;s leadership x201C;as the worst period in relations between Europe and the US since the world war.x201D;
Bays said that on the other hand, some allies in the Middle East x201C;will be calibrating their responsesx201D;, adding that x201C;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, could not have wished for a better US president for his interests than Trumpx201D;.

Macron hopeful over projected Biden victory
Speaking from Paris, Al Jazeerax2019;s Natacha Butler said French President Emmanuel Macron is hopeful the x201C;America firstx201D; approach to foreign policy will soon end.
x201C;French President Emmanuel Macron has tweeted his congratulations to Biden and Harris saying that he looks forward to working with them on some of todayx2019;s challenges,x201D; Butler said. x201C;There is no doubt that Macron is more closely politically aligned to Biden than he was to Trump.x201D;
x201C;What Macron will be hoping for now is that the US returns to a more multilateral approach when it comes to foreign policy after four years of Trumpx2019;s America-first policy: A return to the Paris climate deal, something that Trump pulled the US out of, and the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump also pulled the US out of, much to the disappointment of Macron,x201D; Butler said.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell told Al Jazeera that celebrations were premature.
x201C;What we have now are several states where the results are heading towards a spread that is so narrow that any hint of irregularities can in fact be prosecuted,x201D; Blackwell, a Republican, said from Philadelphia, referencing Trumpx2019;s promise to challenge results in states across the country.
x201C;There are close races that are still being contested. It is a bit rich that some folks, who never accepted Trumpx2019;s clear victory, are now celebrating off projections,x201D; he said.

The task force will be led by three co-chairs: former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith from Yale University, according to Axios.
The plan, which comes before Biden has appointed his cabinet or White House staff, is an apparent attempt to signal that the pandemic will be his top priority.

Analyst: Harris VP win is an x2018;incredible glass ceiling moment for all women everywherex2019;
Claire Finkelstein, from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, told Al Jazeera that Kamala Harrisx2019;s win is an x201C;incredible glass ceiling moment for all women everywherex201D;.
x201C;Especially as a lawyer to watch future VP Harris getting ready to step to a role that no woman in this country has ever held, especially as a woman of colour, is especially exciting and inspiring to all of us,x201D; she said.
She added that Trumpx2019;s promise to challenge the state results in court x201C;is in a way a sign of health in our democracyx201D;.
x201C;If Donald Trump is willing to accept the deliverances of our court system, then in effect, he is willing to play by the rules. As angry as he is and unwilling to accept the results as he has been, if the court rules and he is willing to accept it, then we are still roughly within the domain of the rule of law,x201D; she said.

Muslim organisations hail Bidenx2019;s vow to end x2018;Muslim banx2019;
The Council on American-Islamic Relations CAIR and the No Muslim Ban Ever grassroots coalition have congratulated Biden, while urging him to follow through on his pledge to end the so-called Muslim ban.
x201C;President-elect Biden has pledged to end the Muslim ban on his first day in office, include Muslims at every level of his administration and address issues of racial and religious discrimination,x201D; said CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad.
x201C;We plan to join other American Muslim leaders and organisations in ensuring that the Biden administration fulfils these promises. We also plan to continue holding our government accountable when it errs,x201D; he said.
In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld a Trump policy that banned travellers from several Muslim-majority countries, saying it was allowed if done for national security. Trumpx2019;s initial 2017 order separated families and left travellers stranded around the world, and has been derided as Islamophobic.

Steve Clemons, host of Al Jazeerax2019;s The Bottom Line
Speaking from Washington, DC, Steve Clemons, host of Al Jazeera Englishx2019;s weekly discussion programme The Bottom Line, said it was yet to be seen how Trump will react to Bidenx2019;s win, but the circle of support around him will begin to shrink.
x201C;The best way to look at what those people around him are saying, is if you go to Laura Ingraham, one of the top Fox News anchors, who regularly speaks to and overtly supports President Trump, shex2019;s saying out loud, leave with dignity, take this moment, reflect on democracy. Donx2019;t drag this out,x201D; he said.

Biden: I am x2018;honored and humbledx2019;
Biden has released his first statement since being projected the winner in the presidential election.
x201C;I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris,x201D; Biden wrote. x201C;In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America.x201D;
x201C;With the campaign over, itx2019;s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. Itx2019;s time for America to unite. And to heal. We are the United States of America. And therex2019;s nothing we canx2019;t do, if we do it together,x201D; Biden said.

America, Ix2019;m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country.
The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans x2014; whether you voted for me or not.
I will keep the faith that you have placed in me. pic.twitter.com/moA9qhmjn8

Trump says Biden x2018;rushing to falsely pose as the winnerx2019;
Trump has said Biden is x201C;rushing to falsely pose as the winnerx201D; of the US election, moments after the Associated Press projected Biden had the electoral votes needed for victory.
x201C;The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,x201D; Trump said in a statement.
In US elections, it is common practice for news organisations, after determining that a candidate no longer has a path to victory, to project a winner in the race. The Trump campaign has said it will challenge the results in several states. Biden flipped battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona x2013; all states Trump won in 2016, according to the Associated Press.
x201C;Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,x201D; Trump wrote. x201C;The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots.x201D;

Al Jazeerax2019;s Hilary Beaumont sent in this report from Philadelphia
Saturday morning, Bidenx2019;s lead over Trump grew to 28,877 votes in Pennsylvania, where counting continued in most counties.
The Associated Press news agency has not called the race because of the close margin and large number of outstanding votes. The votes left to count were mostly provisional ballots.
The count stretched on in Allegheny County, where Biden was up by 20 points Friday morning. County executives said they had about 20,000 to 23,000 mail ballots left to count.
Bidenx2019;s lead in the state comes from marginal increases over 2016 Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton in the suburbs and Trump country.
Clinton won Allegheny County, which includes the city of Pittsburgh, by 16.4 points four years ago.
