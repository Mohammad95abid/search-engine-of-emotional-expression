An Egyptian court has sentenced former president Mohamed Morsi and 19 others to three years in prison on charges of insulting the judiciary.
Morsi, democratically elected after Egyptx2019;s 2011 revolution, was deposed following mass protests and a military coup in July 2013.
He served just one year of a four-year term, while the organisation to which he belonged, the Muslim Brotherhood, has since been outlawed.
A government crackdown on the movement, as well as other groups, has since resulted in tens of thousands of arrests and mass trials.
On Saturday, the Cairo Criminal Court convicted Morsi of defaming the judiciary in a speech he made while in officexA0;x201C;with the aim of spreading hatex201D;, according to state television.
The court ordered Morsi to pay one million Egyptian pounds $56,270 as compensation to a judge, whom Morsi had accused of overseeing fraud in a previous election.

Five other accused, including prominent pro-democracy campaigner Alaa Abdel-Fatah, were ordered to pay a fine of 30,000 Egyptian pounds $1,700 each. 
All the rulings can be appealed.
Since his removal, Morsi has been tried in several different cases.
He is already serving a 20-year sentence in another case, on charges of inciting attacks on protesters in 2012.
In September, the top appeals court upheld a separate 25-year term, on charges of harming national security by leaking state documents to Qatar.
