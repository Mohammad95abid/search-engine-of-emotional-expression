The UN has called for a x201C;thorough and transparent investigationx201D; into the death of Mohamed Morsi in court, as thousands of people across the Middle East paid their respects to Egyptx2018;s former president.
The UN human rights office on Tuesday said the investigation should encompass all aspects of his treatment during nearly six years of his incarceration.
Egyptx2019;s first democratically elected president was buried in a small family ceremony early on Tuesday a day after he suffered a fatal heart attack in a Cairo court, his sons said.
x201C;Concerns have been raised regarding the conditions of Mr Morsix2019;s detention, including access to adequate medical care, as well as sufficient access to his lawyers and family x2026;,x201D; UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said in a statement.

x201C;The investigation should be carried out by a judicial or other competent authority that is independent of the detaining authority and mandated to conduct prompt, impartial and effective investigations into the circumstances and causes of his death,x201D; he said.
Morsi was overthrown on July 3, 2013, after barely in power for a year in a coup staged by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and placed under house arrest before being moved to prison.

Morsix2019;s death has brought an outpouring of condolences from around the Middle East.
x201C;I mourn, for myself and all the free people of the world, the death of a great striver on the path of freedom,x201D; said Tawakkol Karman, joint recipient of Nobel Peace Prize.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a prayer service in Istanbul for the former Egyptian president.
At Istanbulx2019;s Fatih mosque, where thousands joined in prayers, Erdogan called Morsi a x201C;martyrx201D; and blamed Egyptx2019;s x201C;tyrantsx201D; for his death, adding that he didnx2019;t believe that Morsi died of natural causes.

x201C;I donx2019;t believe that this was a normal death,x201D; Erdogan, a key supporter of Morsi, said.
The Turkish president also denounced the Egyptian authorities for burying Morsi discreetly, with only a small number of family members and confidants present.

A leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood group, Morsi won Egyptx2019;s first free presidential election in 2012, a year after an uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.
Turkeyx2019;s ruling AK Party supported Morsix2019;s government and many Brotherhood members and supporters have fled to Turkey since its activities were banned in Egypt in 2013.
x201C;There are Arab dissidents and journalists who have been residing in Turkey since the Arab Spring began and people are here to give support for Morsix2019;s cause,x201D; Al Jazeerax2019;s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbulx2019;s Fatih Mosque, said.xA0;
At the time of his death, Morsi, 67, faced a host of legal charges, which he, along with many human rights groups and independent observers, said were politically motivated.
Thousands of members of now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood organisation, who were arrested in the crackdown following the 2013 coup, are still languishing in jails.
Egyptx2019;s government has dismissed accusations that the former president was badly treated.
