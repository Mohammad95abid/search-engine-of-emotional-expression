The flap is the latest sign of new tensions between Arab countriesxA0;x2013; alarmed by Shia and Kurdish domination of IraqxA0;xA0;and Iraqis who say they are notxA0;getting enough support from other Arabs.

xA0;
For Shias around the region, Hosni Mubarakx2019;s remarks hinted at Sunni-led Arab governments lining up against their community.

xA0;
In an interview broadcast on Saturday evening by Al-Arabiya television, Mubarak said: x201C;Definitely Iran has influence on Shias. Shias are 65 of the IraqisxA0;x2026; .xA0;Most of the Shias are loyal to Iran, and not to the countries they are living in.x201D;He said civil war x201C;has almost startedx201D; in Iraq.
xA0;
The interview startled not only Iraqis, but also Shias who form a majority in Iraq and Iran. Shias have minorities in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon and Yemen.
xA0;

The comments are x201C;the engine which drives the whole region towards civil warx201D;, Fouad Ibrahim, a prominent Saudi Shia writer, told AP from his exile in London.


Tiny minority
xA0;
Shias as a sect form a minority in the Muslim world; they are estimated at 15-20 ofxA0;the Muslims around the world.

Mansour al-Jamry, the editor of the Bahraini daily Al-Wasat and a Shia, said the remarks x201C;encourage those who have an interest in dividing the Arab nationx201D;.
x201C;We do not beg for certificates of allegiance to our countries from Mubarak or others,x201D; Kuwaiti Shia lawmaker Hassan Jawhar said in a news conference in parliament.
xA0;

Jalal Talabani,xA0;the Kurdish president of Iraq, said on Sunday that Mubarakx2019;s comments were not accurate.
xA0;
x201C;It is true that there are some kind of clashes among Sunnis and Shias. But it is not civil war. I think Iraqi people in general are against civil war and there is no chance for any civil war,x201D; he told Britainx2018;s Channel 4 News.

Denial
Jack Straw, the UK foreignxA0;secretary,xA0;reiterated his governmentx2019;s stance of denying that civil war in Iraq was imminent or inevitable but said the situation was x201C;very seriousx201D;.
He said claims of an imminent civil war were x201C;frustratingx201D; given that Iraq was on the verge of installing a democratic and permanent government. But the process was taking x201C;too longx201D;, he told thexA0;BBCx2019;s Sunday AM programme.xA0;

Mubarak rarely has commented on the situation in Iraq x2013; and usually his statements are broad and vague expressions of concern over violence and political turmoil.
xA0;
Arab leaders generally avoid criticisms of fellow leaders.
xA0;

Mubarakx2019;s spokesman, Suleiman Awad, tried on Sunday to soften the impact. He said the president was talking about Shia sympathy with Iran x201C;in view of its hosting of Shia holy shrinesx201D;.
x201C;The presidentx2019;s statement about Iraq was only reflecting his increasing worries about the deteriorating situation and his keenness to maintain Iraqx2018;s national unity,x201D; Awad said in a statement carried by the state news agency, MENA.

Annoyed
xA0;
Iraqx2019;s interim leaders said they were x201C;annoyedx201D; by Mubarakx2019;s remarks.

x201C;This is a stab in their Shiax2019;s patriotism and their civilisation,x201D; Iraqx2018;s three highest ranked Kurdish, Shia and Sunni Arab leaders x2013; Talabani, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the prime minister, and Adnan Pachachi, the parliament speakerxA0;x2013; said in a joint statement on Sunday.

Talabani later told Iraqi television: x201C;Reality and historical facts show that the Shias always have been patriotic and genuine Iraqis.
xA0;

x201C;This unfair accusation against Shia is baseless,x201D; he said.
Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi foreign minister,xA0;complained to his Egyptian counterpart, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, about Mubarakx2019;s remarks, an Iraqi diplomat in Cairo said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to release the information.

BlamexA0;
xA0;
Last month, Zebari lashed out at Arab leaders in a summit in Sudanx2019;s capital x2013; that Mubarak did not attend x2013; telling them they were to blame if Iran had influence because they had not supported Iraq since Saddam Husseinx2019;s fall in 2003.
xA0;
He pointed to their failure to follow through on promises to send ambassadors to Baghdad.

Arab nations appear increasingly worried about Iranian influence in Iraq.
xA0;
Last year, Jordanx2018;s King Abdullah II said Iran was seeking to create x201C;a Shia crescentx201D; that would disrupt the balance of power in the region. 
xA0;
Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister,xA0;made similar comments.
xA0;
Arab leaders at the Khartoum, Sudan,xA0;summit deep concern over plans for US-Iranian talks over Iraq, fearing that meant they could no more have a say in the country.
Arab governments are countering by trying to form their own united stance on Iraq. Arab foreign ministers are to meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Iraq.

Intelligence tie-up
Last week, Arab diplomats told The Associated Press that top intelligence officers from several Arab countries and Turkey had been meeting secretly to co-ordinate their governmentsx2019; strategies in case civil war erupted in Iraq, and to block Iranian interference. 
Turkey, a non-Arab Sunni Muslim nation bordering Iraq, is worried about Iraqx2018;s split into sectarian and ethnic entities that will give rise to Kurdish ambitions for independence.
xA0;
The Cairo-based Arab League is also planning a meeting of leaders of the Iraqi factions in June.
