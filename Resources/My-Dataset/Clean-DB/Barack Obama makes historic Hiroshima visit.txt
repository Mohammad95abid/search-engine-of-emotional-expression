Obama also greeted ageing survivors and embraced one elderly man who appeared overcome with emotion.
Al Jazeerax2019;s Harry Fawcett, reporting from Hiroshima, said Obama tried in his speech to strike the right balance in terms of the audience in Japan but also people listening to him back in the US.
x201C;This is something that no president in the 71 years since the bomb was dropped here has felt able to do,x201D; our correspondent said.
x201C;So he tried to strike that balance by both talking about the specifics of what happened here, but also trying to put in the context not only of the Second World War, but also of human morality.x201D;
