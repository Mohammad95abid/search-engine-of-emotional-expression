While the news of the death of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has attracted widespread Arab x2013; and to a lesser extent x2013; international media coverage, it has not received much attention from newspapers in Egypt.
The 67-year-old, who collapsed during a court appearance on Monday and was later declared dead in a Cairo hospital, was the countryx2019;s first democratically elected president.
He came to office in June 2012, a year after the Arab Spring uprising saw the end of President Hosni Mubarakx2019;s 30-year rule.
But Morsi only served one year of his four-year mandate before he faced massive street protests and was removed in a military coup, led by Egyptx2019;s current President Abdel Fattah el-SisixA0;in July 2013.
On Tuesday, there was almost no front page coverage of Morsix2019;s death in Egyptx2019;s major newspapers. Instead, the news was reported briefly on the inside pages which are usually devoted to monitoring criminal cases.
The reports made no mention of Morsix2019;s status as either a former or an overthrown president.

According to the privately owned online newspaper Mada Masr, the only major daily paper to feature news of Morsix2019;s death on its front page was Al-Masry Al-Youm, while most other papers published the same 42-word news article.
The three main state-owned newspapers described the ex-president as either x201C;the accusedx201D; or x201C;the deceasedx201D;, with some privately owned papers not even mentioning the news.
This was also reflected on Egyptian satellite television channels, which relayed the news in vague and abrupt terms, and referred to the Muslim Brotherhood organisation, to which Morsi belonged, as a x201C;terroristx201D; group.
The largest state-owned newspaper Al Ahram published the news of Morsix2019;s death on the margins of its fourth page under the heading: x201C;The death of Mohamed Morsi during his trial in the espionage casex201D;.
The Al Akhbar paperx2019;s coverage was similar and included one paragraph entitled: x201C;The death of Mohamed Morsi during his trial.x201D;
The Al Gomhuria paper published a short paragraph at the bottom of its third page under a similar heading.
There was no official statement from the Egyptian presidency or el-Sisi regarding Morsix2019;s death.
His burial, attended by some of his family members, was a hurried affair that took place at dawn, with security officials standing guard outside the Al-Wafaa Wa al-Amal cemetery. No journalists or other mourners were allowed to be present.

x201C;We washed his noble body at Tora prison hospital, performed prayers for him in the prison mosque x2026; the burial was at the cemetery for Muslim Brotherhood spiritual guides,x201D; Morsix2019;s son, Ahmed, wrote on Facebook.
According to Morsix2019;s lawyer, the former president wanted to be buried in his village in Sharqiyah province, but the Egyptian authorities decided to bury him at a cemetery in Cairox2019;s Medinat Nasr.
Under el-Sisi, media censorship in Egypt has all butxA0;increasedxA0;at a drastic pace. In 2018, the president ratified the Anti-Cyber and Information Technology Crimes Law, which ostensibly aims to combat x201C;extremismx201D; and x201C;terrorismx201D;.
However, the law allows Egyptian authorities to block websites that are considered x201C;a threat to national securityx201D; or to the x201C;national economy.x201D; Individuals who visit these websites can face steep fines and penalties.
According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression AFTE, Cairo has blocked access to almost 500 websites, most of them belonging to media organisations. Furthermore, at least 35 journalists, citizen-journalists, and bloggers are believed to be currently detained in Egypt.

He was facing at least six trials at the time of his death and was also serving a 20-year prison sentence for a conviction arising from the killing of protesters during demonstrations in 2012. In addition, he was serving a life sentence for espionage in a case related to the Gulf state of Qatar.
Other charges against the former president included jailbreak, insulting the judiciary and involvement in x201C;terrorismx201D;.
His supporters say the charges against him were politically motivated.
There were also reports over the years that Morsi had been mistreated and tortured in jail, with activists saying on Monday his death should be seen in the context of the Egyptian authoritiesx2019; systematic isolation and mistreatment of political detainees.
Human Rights Watch called the news of Morsix2019;s death x201C;terriblex201D; but x201C;entirely predictablex201D;, citing the governmentx2019;s x201C;failure to allow him adequate medical carex201D;.
x201C;The government of Egypt today bears responsibility for his death, given their failure to provide him with adequate medical care or basic prisoner rights,x201D; the group said in a statement to Al Jazeera.
