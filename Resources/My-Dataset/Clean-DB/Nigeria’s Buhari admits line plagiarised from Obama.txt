Nigeriax2019;s President Muhammadu Buhari plagiarised quotes from US President Barack Obama in a speech promising change in the West African country, according to a statement by his office.
Buhari made the address last week to launch a campaign entitled x201C;Change begins with me,x201D; part of his credo to end corruption in Africax2019;s biggest economy, which is gripped by mismanagement and poverty despite sitting on vast energy reserves.
However, his office said on Friday that a paragraph in the speech urging Nigerians not to fall back x201C;on the same partisanship, pettiness and immaturity that have poisoned our country so longx201D; was copied from Obamax2019;s victory speech after his election in November 2008.
x201C;It was observed that the similarities between a paragraph in President Obamax2019;s 2008 victory speech and what President Buhari read in paragraph nine of the 16-paragraph address x2026; are too close to be passed as coincidence,x201D; his office said in a statement.

x201C;President Buhari urges Nigerians to look beyond this incident and focus on the message of change which the country needs in order to restore our cherished value systems,x201D; the office said after a Twitter user joked about the incident.
x201C;Those responsiblex201D; would be punished, the office said, adding that a deputy director in the presidency had admitted the mistake.
Nigeria, which ranks 136 out of 168 countries in Transparency Internationalx2019;s Corruption Perception Index for 2015, has struggled for years to fight corruption among its political elite.
But since Buhari was elected to power in 2014 on a campaign that vowed to root out corruption, anti-fraud agencies have arrested several senior politicians accused of embezzlement.
