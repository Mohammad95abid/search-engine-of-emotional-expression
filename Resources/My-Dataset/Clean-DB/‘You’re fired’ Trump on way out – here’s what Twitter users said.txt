Itx2019;s official. Donald Trump is on the way out.
United States presidential candidate Joe Biden has passed the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to win the White House, according to projections by several media outlets.
The Democratic candidate is now set to become the 46th president of the US.
x201C;I am honoured and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Kamala Harris,x201D; Biden, 77, said in a statement a few minutes after the projections were announced some four days since the polls closed.
With people across the US and in different parts of the world closely following the presidential race, Twitter was set ablaze as soon as the news broke.
Unsurprisingly, many social users reacted to the projections by citing Trumpx2019;s famous dismissal of contestants on his television show, The Apprentice: x201C;Youx2019;re fired!x201D;
