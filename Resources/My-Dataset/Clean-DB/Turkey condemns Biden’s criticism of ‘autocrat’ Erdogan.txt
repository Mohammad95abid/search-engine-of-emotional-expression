Turkey has condemned remarks made by US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticising President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and calling for support for the Turkish leaderx2019;s opponents.
Biden made the comments in an interview filmed by the New York Times in December, but a video of the remarks only appeared on Saturday before going viral on social media.
Asked about Erdogan, Biden described the Turkish president as an x201C;autocratx201D;, criticised his policy towards the Kurds, and advocated supporting the Turkish opposition.
x201C;What I think we should be doing is taking a very different approach to him now, making it clear that we support opposition leadership,x201D; Biden said.
x201C;He has to pay a price,x201D; Biden said at the time, adding that Washington should embolden Turkish opposition leaders x201C;to be able to take on and defeat Erdogan. Not by a coup, not by a coup, but by the electoral process.x201D;
The comments did not provoke much reaction when they were published in January, but the video of the interview triggered an angry response from Turkey.
x201C;The analysis of Turkey by JoeBiden is based on pure ignorance, arrogance and hypocrisy,x201D; Erdoganx2019;s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin tweeted.

The analysis of Turkey by JoeBiden is based on pure ignorance, arrogance and hypocrisy. 
The days of ordering Turkey around are over. 
But if you still think you can try, be our guest.
You will pay the price.

Erdoganx2019;s communications director Fahrettin Altun said the comments x201C;reflect games and an interventionist approach towards Turkeyx201D; and are inconsistent with current diplomatic relations.
x201C;Nobody can attack our nationx2019;s will and democracy or question the legitimacy of our President, who was elected by popular vote,x201D; Altun said on Twitter.
x201C;We believe that these unbecoming statements which have no place in diplomacy by a presidential candidate from our NATO ally, the United States, are unacceptable to the current administration too,x201D; he added.
Bidenx2019;s statements also embarrassed Erdoganx2019;s opponents, who the Turkish government regularly accuses of being in the pay of foreign powers.
Several officials of the main opposition CHP party quickly distanced themselves from Bidenx2019;s remarks, calling for x201C;respect for the sovereignty of Turkeyx201D;.
Erdogan has worked to cultivate a personal relationship with current US President Donald Trump x2013; who is running for re-election in November this year x2013; and often lashes out at Trumpx2019;s predecessor, Barack Obama.
Biden x2013; who is expected to be Trumpx2019;s opponent in the upcoming election x2013; was Obamax2019;s vice president.
Relations between Ankara and Washington were strained during Obamax2019;s second term, particularly because of disagreements over Syria and growing international criticism over freedoms and rights in Turkey.
While Trump and Erdogan speak regularly, diplomatic relations have been strained over Ankarax2019;s purchase of Russian air defences, policy in Syria and over US charges against a Turkish state bank for allegedly helping Iran evade sanctions.
