The five-page transcript of a conversation between Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair reveals that Blair talked Bush out of launching a military strike on the station, unnamed sources told the daily.

The transcript of the pairx2019;s talks during Blairx2019;s 16 April 2004 visit to Washington allegedly shows Bush wanted to attack the satellite channelx2019;s headquarters in Doha, Qatar.
Blair allegedly feared such a strike, in the capital of Qatar, a key Western ally in the Gulf, would spark revenge attacks.
Aljazeera has said in a news statement that it is investigating the report and urged the US and British governments to challenge it.

A British civil servant has been charged under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly leaking the government memo.
Civil servant accused
Cabinet Office civil servant David Keogh is accused of passing the memo to Leo Ox2019;Connor, who formerly worked for former British lawmaker Tony Clarke.
Both Keogh and Ox2019;Connor are scheduled to appear at Londonx2019;s Bow Street Magistrates Court next week.







x201C;This doesnx2019;t surprise me. Whenever there is truth x2013; unpleasant truth x2013; it seems this administration wants to bomb it.x201D; US
x201C;You guys have reached a new low in shamelessness. The Daily Mirror? x2026;It is a rag, filled with lies and half truths.x201D; USMore commentsx2026;






According to the Daily Mirror, Clarke returned the memo to Blairx2019;s office. Clarke could not immediately be contacted for comment on Tuesday.
The Mirror on Tuesday quoted an unnamed British government official as saying Bushx2019;s threat was x201C;humorous, not seriousx201D;.
Aljazeerax2019;sxA0;coverage of the war in Iraq had drawn criticism from Washington after the US-led March 2003 invasion.
A source told the Mirror: x201C;The memo is explosive and hugely damaging to Bush.


x201C;He made clear he wanted to bomb Aljazeera in Qatar and elsewhere. Blair replied that would cause a big problem.
x201C;Therex2019;s no doubt what Bush wanted to do x2013; and no doubt Blair didnx2019;t want him to do it.x201D;
Deadly serious
Another source said: x201C;Bush was deadly serious, as was Blair. That much is absolutely clear from the language used by both men.x201D;
A spokesman for Blairx2019;s Downing Street office said: x201C;We have got nothing to say about this story. We donx2019;t comment on leaked documents.x201D;

Clarke, the former lawmaker, told Britainx2019;s domestic Press Association news agency that Ox2019;Connor had done x201C;exactly the right thingx201D; in bringing it to his attention.
The Mirror said such a strike would have been x201C;the most spectacular foreign-policy disaster since the Iraq war itselfx201D;.
The newspaper said that the memo x201C;casts fresh doubt on claims that other attacks on Aljazeera were accidentsx201D;. It cited the 2001 direct hit on the channelx2019;sxA0;Kabul office in Afghanistan.
In April 2003, an Aljazeera journalist died when its Baghdad office was struck during a US bombing campaign. Nabil Khoury, a US State Department spokesman in Doha, said the strike was a mistake.
In November 2002, Aljazeerax2019;s office in Kabul, Afghanistan, was destroyed by a US missile. None of the crew was at the office at the time. US officials said they believed the target was a terrorist site and did not know it was Aljazeerax2019;s office.
Downing Street challenged
Blairx2019;s former defence minister Peter Kilfoyle challenged Downing Street to publish the transcript.

x201C;I believe that Downing Street ought to publish this memo in the interests of transparency, given that much of the detail appears to be in the public domain,x201D;xA0;Kilfoyle told the Press Association.

x201C;I think they ought to clarify what exactly happened on this occasion. If it was the case that President Bush wanted to bomb Aljazeera in what is after all a friendly country, it speaks volumes and it raises questions about subsequent attacks that took place on the press that wasnx2019;t embedded with coalition forces.x201D;

Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell told the Press Association: x201C;If true, then this underlines the desperation of the Bush administration as events in Iraq began to spiral out of control.
x201C;On this occasion, the prime minister may have been successful in averting political disaster, but it shows how dangerous his relationship with President Bush has been.x201D;
Abd al-Bari Atwanx2019;s reaction
Speaking to Aljazeera from London on Monday, Abd al-Bari Atwan, chief editor of the London-based Al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper, said: x201C;The issue of Bushx2019;s plan to bomb Aljazeerax2019;s headquarters in Doha will be widely discussed in Washington and London.xA0;x201C;Reporters in the US and Britain are enraged by reported US plans to use force against media organs.xA0;xA0;
