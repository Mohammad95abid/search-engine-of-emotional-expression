International organisations including the UN and African Union, politicians and people from African countries and Caribbeans are outraged over US President Donald Trumpx2018;s latest racist remarks.
The president criticised immigration to his country from El Salvador, Haiti and the African continent, by calling the group x201C;shithole countriesx201D;, according to the US media.
x201C;Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?x201D; Trump asked at a meeting with congress members at the White House, reports said on Thursday, citing people with knowledge on the conversation.
Trump suggested the US should instead focus its immigrant entry policy on countries such as Norway.xA0;

These are racist comments. He has said things like this before when he talked about Nigerians who wonapos;t go back to live in huts and he talked about Haitians who bring AIDS to the United States. These are all confirmations of what a lot of people have long suspected - that he harbours racism
Bill Schneider, Washington, DC-based political analyst 


Rupert Colville, spokesman of the UN human rights office, said: x201C;You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as shitholes x2026;xA0;Ix2019;m sorry, but therex2019;s no other word one can use but racist.x201D;
Colville added the story wasnx2019;t x201C;just a story about vulgar language, itx2019;s about opening the door to humanityx2019;s worst sidex201D;.
The African Union said it was x201C;frankly alarmedx201D;.xA0;
x201C;Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,x201D; said AU spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo.
Haitix2018;s government said Trumpx2019;s reported comments shows a x201C;racist view of the Haitian communityx201D;, while El Salvador sent a formal letter of protest to the US saying TrumpxA0;had x201C;implicitlyx201D; accepted the use of x201C;harsh terms detrimental to the dignity of El Salvador and other countriesx201D;.xA0;xA0;
Tough languagexA0;
Trump denied the racist remarks, tweeting on Friday that the language he used x201C;was tough, but this was not the language usedx201D;, as he called for a x201C;merit-based system of immigration and people who take our country to the next levelx201D;.
He later tweeted that he has x201C;never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously a very poor and troubled countryx201D;.xA0;
But Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator who attended the meeting, disputed Trumpx2019;s account.xA0;
x201C;He said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,x201D; Durbin told reporters.xA0;
Trump questioned why the US should accept more immigrants from Haiti, Durbin said, adding that x201C;shitholesx201D; was the x201C;exact wordx201D; the US leader used to describe countries in Africa.xA0;
The White House did not directly challenge the authenticity of Trumpx2019;s comments, but issued a statement saying: x201C;Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people.x201D;
x2018;Extremely offensivex2019;
Rene Civil, an activist in Haiti, said that Trump is x201C;destabilising, a president who uses vulgar words, who is unacceptablex201D;.xA0;
Civil added: x201C;We Haitians demand that Donald Trump apologise to the entire African continent, as well as before Haiti, a country whose blood has been used by ancestors who have used their minds and bodies to liberate the United States itself from slaveryx201D;.xA0;
South Africax2018;s ruling ANC party said Trumpx2019;s comments were x201C;extremely offensivex201D;, with a spokeswoman saying the party would never deign to make such derogatory remarks.
Morocco-based Africa analyst Adama Gaye told Al Jazeera: x201C;Trump has shown a continuous display of racism towards Africa and people from poor nations.x201D;
Abdulsalam Kayode, a resident of the Nigeriax2018;sxA0;capital Lagos, told Al Jazeera that the US presidentx2019;s comments are x201C;not unexpected from somebody of this nature because we already know this kind of personx201D;.xA0;
Commenting on the invitation to Norwegians, Washington DC-based political analyst Bill Schneider told Al Jazeera: x201C;Thatx2019;s the racist element. Norwegians are white, theyx2019;re northern Europeans. He was referring earlier, in his vulgar comment, to people of African descent.xA0;
x201C;These are racist comments. He has said things like this before when he talked about Nigerians who wonx2019;t go back to live in huts and he talked about Haitians who bring AIDS to the United States. These are all confirmations of what a lot of people have long suspected x2013; that he harbours racism.x201D;
Many took to social media to condemn the president, including members of his own Republican party.
Republican politician Mia Love, who is of Haitian descent, said: x201C;The presidentx2019;s comments are unkind, divisive, elitist and fly in the face of our nationx2019;s values.x201D;

Democratic State Senator Linda Dorcena Forry said on Twitter: x201C;I have to first express how demoralising amp; upsetting it is to have to register my outrage again and again over hateful remarks made by my own president.x201D; 
She then posted a statement saying: x201C;Ix2019;m very disappointed in us, the people of the United States, who saw fit to elect an ignorant, mean-spirited, white supremacist to the most powerful office in the world.x201D;

So, about 1.5 billion people. 20 of the world. Week isnx2019;t over.x201D;
