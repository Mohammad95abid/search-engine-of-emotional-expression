US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed outrage during a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi over the death of a imprisoned American citizen.
Pompeo derided the x201C;pointless and tragic deathx201D; of US national Moustafa Kassem following his protracted hunger strike, a US official said on Sunday.
The United States confirmed the death of Egyptian-American Kassem in a prison last week in Egypt, where he had been in custody since 2013, and promised to continue to raise concerns over Cairox2019;s human rights record.
An Egyptian presidency statement on the el-Sisi-Pompeo meeting made no mention of Kassemx2019;s case.
Pompeox2019;s sharp remarks signal the US government intended to place the death of Kassem, 54, high on the diplomatic agenda on the sidelines of an international peace summit in BerlinxA0;aiming to end Libyax2019;s civil war.
The death of the auto-parts dealer from Long Island, New York prompted an outcry from human rights groups, as well as accusations of medical negligence in Egyptx2019;s prisons.
The case also touched a nerve in Washington, which has cultivated close security and diplomatic ties with Egypt despite growing unease over its human rights violations under general-turned-president el-Sisi.
Activists and foreign affairs experts have called on the Trump administration to penalise its staunch Middle Eastern ally by slashing millions of dollars in security assistance. The US grants $1.2bn in annual military aid to Egypt.
Kassem was detained by Egypt in 2013 in what his lawyers described as a vast dragnet during the violent dispersal of a protester sit-in that killed hundreds of people. He was later sentenced to 15 years under a contentious anti-protest law the government often uses to silence dissent.
He maintained his innocence throughout his detention and started a hunger strike last year in protest.
El-Sisi came to power in the summer of 2013 and has overseen a sweeping crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands.
