The assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist will make United States President-elect Joe Bidenx2019;s ability to restart diplomacy between Washington and Tehran even more difficult, US-based analysts said on Friday, just hours after Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed.
Biden, who will take office on January 20, has said he wants to return to a 2015 international accord that curbed the Iranian nuclear programme x2013; a move that would signal a pullback from President Donald Trumpx2019;s hardline x201C;maximum pressurex201D; campaign against Iran.
While it remained unclear who was responsible for Fakhrizadehx2019;s killing outside Tehran, Iranian officials pointed the finger at Israel, a key US ally that has advocated for Trumpx2019;s hardline position against the Iranian government.
x201C;You can imagine how open the United States would be to negotiations if x2026; before they could start, the Iranians would do something like this against Israel or against the US itself,x201D; said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC.

If the Iranian government responds, Netanyahu can drag Washington into a military confrontation with Tehran, Parsi said, while if Iran shows restraint, the Israeli leader has created an atmosphere that makes US diplomacy with Iran more difficult.
Israel, which for years has been accused of conducting a series of targeted killings of Iranian nuclear scientists, declined to immediately comment on Fakhrizadehx2019;s assassination.
x201C;From Netanyahux2019;s perspective, this is a moment for him to be able to undermine Biden. In some ways, Biden is the real target here,x201D; Parsi told Al Jazeera.
Renewed nuclear deal
The Trump administration unilaterally withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 as part of its push to isolate Tehran, and it has levelled economic sanctions against key Iranian industries and officials.
Political analysts and observers have raised concerns that Trump will take further action in the last weeks of his administration to further destabilise Iran and its allies in the Middle East x2013; and put the incoming Biden administration in a difficult position when it takes office.
Bidenx2019;s nominee for US Secretary of State Tony Blinken told world security leaders at a conference in August that he hoped the US could build on a renewed nuclear agreement with Iran that would be x201C;stronger and longerx201D;.

He added that US and Iranian officials are hoping to discuss other matters, such as ballistic missiles and regional politics, but Fridayx2019;s assassination has made the prospect of that even more difficult.
x201C;The likelihood that the Iranians are going to be able to be open to compromise and engagement x2026; is clearly severely damaged,x201D; Parsi said.
x2018;Combustiblex2019; moment
Neither Trump nor Biden commented directly on Fakhrizadehx2019;s assassination on Friday, though the Republican president retweeted Israeli writer Yossi Melman, who said the scientistx2019;s death x201C;is a major psychological and professional blow for Iranx201D;.
Top current and former US officials publicly raised concerns, however, including ex-CIA Director John Brennan, who called the attack x201C;a criminal act amp; highly recklessx201D;.
x201C;Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage amp; to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits,x201D; Brennan tweeted.
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said he had not been briefed on the assassination of Fakhrizadeh, but that x201C;every time America or an ally assassinates a foreign leader outside a declaration of war, we normalize the tactic as a tool of statecraft.x201D;

If the primary purpose of the killing of Mr. Fakhrizadeh was to make it harder to restart the Iran nuclear agreement, then this assassination does not make America, Israel or the world safer.

Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the assassination comes at a x201C;combustiblex201D; moment.
In mid-November, Trump asked senior advisers for options to strike Iranx2019;s nuclear research facility at Natanz before he leaves office, according to US media reports. An Iranian government spokesman warned of a x201C;crushing responsex201D; if Iran were to be attacked.
The US Air Force then flew a long-range B-52 bomber from its base in North Dakota to the Middle East x201C;to deter aggression and reassure US partners and alliesx201D;, the US Central Command said on November 21.















x201C;Between now and the onset of the Biden administration x2013; because of the Iranian concern about provoking a unilateral strike by Trump on Natanz x2013; they really are constrained in terms of retaliating,x201D; Miller told Al Jazeera.
x201C;The Israelis can calculate that now is a good time to do stuff like this,x201D; Miller said.
x201C;You could see a series of factors coming together that could make the next few months pretty combustible.x201D;
More provocations?
While the assassination of Fakhrizadeh was shocking to some, Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denverx2019;s School of International Studies, said in the context of recent Iran-US relations, it x201C;fits a pre-existing patternx201D;.
x201C;The pattern is the attempt by the Trump administration to bring Iran to its knees, to possibly topple the regime, to cripple it through maximum sanctions,x201D; Hashemi told Al Jazeera.
He likened Fakhrizadehx2019;s killing to the US assassination of top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a Trump-ordered drone strike on January 3 near Baghdad international airport.















x201C;We almost had a US-Iran war at that time,x201D; said Hashemi, adding that with Trump only a few weeks away from the end of his presidency, more actions x201C;hoping to provoke Iran into a retaliationx201D; are likely.
That will make future US-Iran negotiations much more difficult, he said, x201C;and thatx2019;s precisely the pointx201D;.
