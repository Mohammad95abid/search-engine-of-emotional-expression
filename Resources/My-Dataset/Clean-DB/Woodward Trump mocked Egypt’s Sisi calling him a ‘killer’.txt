US President Donald Trump reportedly mocked Egyptx2019;s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and referred to him as a x201C;f***ing killerx201D;, according to investigative journalist Bob Woodward.
In an excerpt from Woodwardx2019;s recently released book,xA0;Fear: Trump in the White House, the US leader made the remarks afterxA0;securing the release of Aya Hijazi, an American Egyptian who was detained by Cairo for three years.
Woodward claimed that Trump was talking to then-White House legal adviser John Dowd about his negotiations with Sisi over Hijazix2019;s release.
Trump reportedly told Dowd: x201C;Remember who Ix2019;m talking to. The guyx2019;s a f***ing killer. This guyx2019;s a f***ing killer! Ix2019;m getting it done. Hex2019;ll make you sweat on the phone.
The book then describes Trump as assuming a x201C;deep grovelling voicex201D; apparently intending to mimic Sisi x2013; x201C;Donald, Ix2019;m worried about this Mueller investigation. Are you going to be around? Suppose I need a favour, Donald?x201D;

According to Woodward, Trump called Sisix2019;s comments, which were apparently in reference to Robert Muellerx2019;s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, a x201C;kick in the nutsx201D;.
Hijazi was released from jail in April 2017, after nearly three years of imprisonment on human trafficking charges, which were widely dismissed as bogus by human rights groups.
Weeks earlier, Trump had invited Sisi to the White House, something former President Barack Obama had never done, and described him as a x201C;fantastic guyx201D;.
Less than a year later, when Sisi won Egyptx2019;s election with 97 percent of the vote, Trump expressed his x201C;sincere congratulationsx201D; to Sisi in a phone call.
Erratic andxA0;uninformed
Woodwardx2019;s book, which was released on Tuesday after a widely publicised buildup, paints a highly-critical picture of life inside the Oval Office, painting Trumpx2019;s character as dangerously erratic and uninformed.
It also claimed that Trump wanted to assassinate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after an alleged chemical attack last April.
The book quoted Trump as saying: x201C;Letx2019;s f***ing kill him! Letx2019;s go in. Letx2019;s kill the f***ing lot of themx201D;.
On the eve of its release, Trump took to Twitter to denounce Woodwardx2019;s accounts as works of x201C;fictionx201D;.

The Woodward book is a Joke x2013; just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction. Dems canx2019;t stand losing. Ix2019;ll write the real book!

Cairo and Washington have forged close ties under Trump after years of tension under thexA0;ObamaxA0;administration.
Obama temporarily halted military aid to Egypt after the Sisi-led overthrow of Egyptx2019;s first freely elected president,xA0;Mohamed Morsi, a member of thexA0;Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013. His administration also repeatedly criticised the Egyptian governmentx2019;s crackdown on political opponents.
Since the July 2013 coup, a police crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood x2013; which maintains it is peaceful but has been designated byxA0;Egyptx2019;s government as a x201C;terroristx201D; group x2013;xA0;has left hundreds dead and tens of thousands in jail.xA0;
Last year, a UN investigation found that Egypt engages in the continuous persecution of women, human rights activists, and journalists.
Human rights groups estimate that at least 40,000 political prisoners have been detained by Sisix2019;s government.
